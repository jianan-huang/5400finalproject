Banks are howling. They may have a point.","url":"https:\/\/www.nakedcapitalism.com\/2024\/11\/wall-street-banks-accused-of-trying-to-sabotage-key-consumer-protection-rule.html","published_at":"2024-11-16T08:58:25Z","content":"Yves here. As much as banks do try to increase the cost to customers of switching banks, depending on what the Consumer Financial Protection proposed rule about requiring a bank to \u201cunlock\u201d a departing customer\u2019s financial data and transferring it to the new bank amounts to, the banks may have a very legitimate beef. I do not know how many customers find access to historical records to be important. I have to assume small business customers do since payment records are almost certainly needed in the event of an IRS audit. Yes, you can retain them locally, but I prefer having the security of knowing I can get them from the bank if needed. Merely from my dealing with three banks (Citi, TD and PNC), it is clear they retain historical information in very different formats. For instance, in my Citi small business account, which has an entirely different (more stringent) login process than their consumer accounts, I have been stymied in locating images of cancelled checks (Citi is very anti-check, this may be part of their effort to discourage use). TD by contrast links small business to consumer accounts of the owner. They also includes check images in monthly statements for a fee; otherwise, if you want TD to run them down later, the past and perhaps still current practice is for TD to run them down for a fee. PNC does not include them with statements, evah; you can download images painfully, check number by check number, from the bank website. Similarly, TD only allows downloading of transaction data in a CSV format for a very limited time, as in the past two months, while Citi does not seem to impose time limits. So if any of these banks were to export their data to a recipient bank, the odds that it could affordably made it accessible to new customers seems like a fantasy. However, to support the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus\u2019s beef, many (I assume all) banks wipe historical data when you close an account. I apologize for not running down the fine points on this debate. Knowledgeable readers are encouraged to fill in the gaps. By Julia Conley, staff writer at Common Dreams. Originally published at Common Dreams Consumer advocates applauded last month as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized a rule aimed at making it easier for people to switch financial institutions if they\u2019re unhappy with a bank\u2019s service, without the bank retaining their personal data\u2014but on Thursday, more than a dozen groups warned the CFPB that major Wall Street firms are trying to stop Americans from benefiting from the rule. Several advocacy groups, led by the Demand Progress Education Fund, wrote to CFPB director Rohit Chopra warning that major banks\u2014including JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citi, TD Bank, and Wells Fargo\u2014sit on the board of the Financial Data Exchange (FDX), which has applied to the bureau for standard-setting body (SSB) status, which would give it authority over what is commonly known as the \u201copen banking rule.\u201d Standard-setting authority for the banks would present a major conflict of interest, said the groups. The banks are also on the board of the Bank Policy Institute, which promptly filed what the consumer advocates called a \u201cfrivolous lawsuit\u201d to block the open banking rule when it was introduced last month, claiming it will keep banks from protecting customer data. At a panel discussion this week, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan also said the open banking rule, by requiring financial firms to unlock a consumer\u2019s financial data and transfer it to another provider for free, would cause \u201cchaos\u201d and amplify concerns over fraud. The groups wrote on Thursday that big banks want to continue to \u201cmaintain their dominance by making it unduly difficult for consumers to switch institutions.\u201d \u201cThe presence of these organizations on both the FDX and BPI boards undermines the credibility of FDX and presents various concerns relating to conflict of interest, interlocking directorate, and antitrust law,\u201d they wrote. Upon introducing the finalized rule last month, Chopra said the action would \u201cgive people more power to get better rates and service on bank accounts, credit cards, and more\u201d and help those who are \u201cstuck in financial products with lousy rates and service.\u201d The coalition of consumer advocacy groups\u2014including Public Citizen, the American Economic Liberties Project, and Americans for Financial Reform\u2014urged Chopra to reject FDX\u2019s application for standard-setting authority so long as the banks remain on its board. \u201cIt would be a flagrant conflict of interest for the same banks who are suing to block the open banking rule because it threatens their market dominance to also be in charge of implementing it,\u201d said Demand Progress Education Fund corporate power director Emily Peterson-Cassin. \u201cThe American people are fed up with Wall Street controlling every aspect of their lives and the open banking rule is an opportunity to give all of us some financial freedom. The CFPB must stop this ploy by the biggest banks to keep us trapped under their thumbs.\u201d The groups called the open banking rule \u201ca historic step forward for the cause of giving consumers true freedom intheir financial lives.\u201d \u201cFor this reason, it is imperative that SSB status not be granted to an organization whose board members are, either directly or through a trade association they are participating in, suing the CFPB to stop the rules from taking effect, particularly when such members may be ethically conflicted from such dual participation,\u201d said the groups. \u201cBy rejecting SSB status for FDX or any other organization with similar conflicts of interest pertaining to Section 1033, the CFPB will help prevent big banks from sabotaging open banking rules.\u201d SO proving it is important to keep an electronic copy of all bank statements. I used to keep paper but no longer \u2013 all have gone on the burn pile!  Having finally fired B of A after a 25 yr relationship in favor of a local Credit Union, so nice to go into a branch and talk with another member. AND \u2013 credit unions share ATM\u2019s nation-wide, no fees, so you can access funds anywhere. B of A had coverage gaps, notably in New England, necessitating opening another account just for New England. CU\u2019s are both local, and through collective agreements, national as well. Perhaps a good model for a federation? SOrt of like we sued to have prior to the Wilson administration\u2019s corrupt and war- and global bank-serving actions \u2013 federal reserve bank, espionage act, entry into foreign wars with no clear US interest, suppression of free speech, jailing of political enemies \u2013 interestingly, repeated by our current Dem administration all. How is it that Dem administrations are responsible for all the wars of the last 125 years (except Iraq, but of course now JWB is an honorary Dem along with Liz Cheney). And it was under the FDR administration that probably the most evil acts of prohibition were enacted \u2013 alcohol prohibition, and cannabis prohibition.  How is it that the Dems are so revered when they have done so much evil to the citizens of the US of A and to the world in general? Not entirely sure how I got here from banking but nonetheless, I have to repeat, the Dem party is pure filth. Especially in its current incarnation. Divadab.  Wilson (Dem) vetoed the Volsted Act (Prohibition) in 1919.  But Congress over rode the veto. FDR repealed Prohibition.  He was a Dem.    Reagan Repubs started the whole \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d thing. divadab: if dems are pure evil, why did Biden appoint Lina Khan to FCC? Conversely, if Trump is pure evil, why did he kill TPP? Both actions are citizen friendly, big business unfriendly. Politics is shaded.  it was under the FDR administration that probably the most evil acts of prohibition were enacted \u2013 alcohol prohibition, and cannabis prohibition. \u2013 divadab This is simply wrong. Alcohol prohibition was the result of the 19th ammendment, passed in 1919. Roosevelt ended prohibition in 1933. It is true that cannabis prohibitioon was criminalized at the Federal level in 1937, but by 1931 marijana was already illegal in 29 states. Google is your friend, unless you have an agenda. Alcohol prohibition is a very old issue, going back to the 1820s.  Mostly a state issue which became an important party platform issue as a differentiator.  Federal prohibition is really just an episode in the larger scheme. I have notice  in my  bank statements now bank can see what i buy. I have a feeling they will sell these data to who knows, is there no limit to these people greed. EU even pass new law where bank can close easily your account. I have a feeling they did it for Russians citizens or people who are pro Russians Electronic banking in the \u201cinformation\u201d age? Here in Hawaii, there is no demand for \u201cmainland\u201d banks.  Our largest, First Hawaiian (started by the husband of Hawaiian royal Princess Bernice Pauahi) was bought out by what eventually was foreign bank but kept local systems and eventually was spun back out as an independent entity.  BofA tried to get into the market by buying Honolulu Fed S&L during the S&L crisis but threw in the towel and sold the branches\/accounts to American Savings (owned by local utility). But in general, I find getting copies of check images is a chore (we use two banks and a credit union).  Other than that all data is in Quicken  (some going back to 1978) so I\u2019m not really dependent on historical data unless I need \u201cofficial\u201d statements. When my father got too old to keep it up I helped him shut down his small business, and my experience is trying to close small business accounts at Chase is the hardest financial thing I have ever done (next to dealing with crappy home loan servicers like Wells Fargo or WaMu). I\u2019m not sure what data exchange the \u201copen banking\u201d effort is designed to apply to.  Does anyone have a link to a summary of the details? If we\u2019re talking about things like: list of online payees, check history, credit card history, etc.  This seems designed to appeal to upper middle class people (like me).  I don\u2019t see how this ability to exchange data helps any working class people actually get a better deal on their bank services.  It seems like \u201cregulation theater\u201d to me. Stockman Bank out of Miles City, Montanny offers \u2018free\u2019 over-50 checking and paper statements via mail (Pony Express!)  include check images.\nIf something is Free, you are the commodity, not sure how they are monetizing my non-glamorous\nnominal consumer life.\nOn line banking forces pass-word changes monthly, I dumped out on it years ago.\nA gal I was helping with a Mortgage declined my attempts to cross-sell her on line banking products (Wells Fargo!). She worked in mergers and acquisitions for Cisco, and said, \u201cI will NEVER  transact on-line.\u201d\nThat was enough for me. Not transacting on line at all is difficult. Risk on a pc can be minimized by using a browser just for financial accounts. I will never put finance related stuff on my phone, including the built in wallet. Far too risky. Won\u2019t get a debit card either. Banks don\u2019t delete your data when you close an account. Under the new consumer law you can request they do (they still keep some data as required by the federal government). I made this request when Wells Fargo, for the second time since I closed my account in 2009, opened an account in my name. No one ever took credit or provided info on how it happened. But they did report deleting me after I requested. PNC says very clearly they do delete your transaction records when you close an account, which is what most consumers and business people value. The data they are required to retain is of the account holder, which I assume is things like your SSN, your address and phone number when you had your account, whether this was a solely-owned or joint account, perhaps the types of accounts you had.  I don\u2019t see this as very useful for customers to ask their banks to provide to them. Can\u2019t speak to other FIs\u2019 practice, but mine as a matter of policy retains statements for 7 years irrespective of whether the account is open or closed (and we don\u2019t even remove access to the online platform for closed accounts, a practice I have loudly complained about for years as a big security risk, to no avail). I have always assumed this is a regulatory requirement, but record retention isn\u2019t exactly in my wheelhouse. Judging by your description of other FI policies, I might\u2019ve been off the mark on that assumption.

Despite, or perhaps because of, the increased interest and investment that the crypto economy and sector had received during the recent election cycle \u2013 powered in no small part by the nearly $200 million spent by crypto lobbyists \u2013 the trends toward wider adoption and utilization continue to accelerate. Such a statement might bring to mind examples such as spot ETF products, stablecoin issuers obtaining larger shares of the payment space, or even the launch of stablecoins by TradFi institutions. The above facts and trends are correct, and have driven broader and deeper integration of cryptoassets throughout the economy, but one other institution has recently published comprehensive research on the implications, opportunities, and challenges of stablecoin adoption. The October 2024 report by the U.S. Treasury to Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee - over 100 pages of quantitative analytics and tables regarding borrowing and other Treasury activities \u2013 could have reasonably been overlooked in the recent deluge of media information and discourse. That said, in that report there are over 20 pages of graphics and data analyzing the status of stablecoins, use how these stablecoins are using and connected to the U.S. Treasury market, and the benefits of tokenized Treasury activities. Put simply, these data points paint a road map for how and why the U.S. Treasury could quickly and comprehensively become a major user of tokenized payments and stablecoins; let\u2019s take a look at a few of them. One of the more interesting data points presented in this report is that the continued growth and proliferation of stablecoins has also led to a increase in the demand for short-dated Treasuries. Citing the analytics of Tether (issuer of USDT) $68.3% of total collateral held by the organization was in the form of U.S. Treasury Bills. In addition to the direct purchase of Treasuring by stablecoin issuers to serve as collateral for the tokens themselves, the report also puts forward another way in which stablecoins are increasing the demand for Treasuries. When compared to the larger cryptoassets and products that provide exposure to bitcoin (such as spot ETFs), stablecoins are viewed as lower risk, which can funnel investor dollars into these instruments during periods of market volatility. Additionally, as the digital asset sector grows, Treasuries may serve a role as an indirect hedge against inflation and \u2013 ultimately \u2013 a low volatility on-chain alternative to stablecoins. As the dollar faces increasing competition for its role as global reserve currency, and foreign buyers of debt may reallocate funds in future, stablecoins may grow into an alternative buyer in the future. Another fact that might surprise some crypto investors is that, even after years of an ambiguous regulatory environment and antagonistic regulations, tokenized Treasuries already exist, albeit at a modest level of approximately $2 billion. For example, tokenized treasury funds are already available to investors via funds such as Blackrock\u2019s BUIDL Fund and Franklin Templeton\u2019s On-Chain U.S. Government Money Fund. In addition to these projects, including the one via Blackrock (also the leading player in the spot bitcoin ETF space) other options include Ondo Financial, Hashnote, and CoinShares. On top of these projects, Onyx at JP Morgan leverages tokenized Treasuries to provide intraday Treasury-backed repo solutions, with the Treasury also noting that smart contracts allow simplification and automation of Treasury transactions. In other words the U.S. Treasury, while contending with other U.S. regulators and policymakers that have pursued an antagonistic approach, is well aware of the benefits of tokenized Treasuries as well as the reality that multiple projects leveraging these benefits already exist. Improvements to current clearing and settlement processes, more efficient collateral management, and better transparency via tokenized records are all duly noted as benefits for increased tokenization of the U.S. Treasury market. Much has been written about the potential for a strategic bitcoin reserve, with the discussion around this idea only increasing with the election of Donald Trump as the 47th President of the United States. As exciting and arguably important as such a plan and strategic initiative is, it is only a partial solution to the problems and challenges facing the U.S. dollar and broader U.S. competitive interests. In order to remain competitive on a global basis, attract the talent necessary to succeed and lead the various industries of the future (including blockchain and tokenized transactions) the U.S. policy apparatus will need to embrace a multi-pronged approach to tokenization. A strategic bitcoin reserve is an excellent first step toward more comprehensive integration of tokenized transactions, but leveraging tokenization and blockchain transactions to improve the expand U.S. Treasury markets is an essential component of any U.S. oriented crypto plan. Crypto dollars are virtually guaranteed, and might reach mainstream adoption sooner than many crypto investors expect.  One Community.

Analysts Warn Of Cash Crunch And Slow Hydrogen Market Growth","description":"Analysts lowered price target on Plug Power after weak Q3 results and FY25 guidance. Company aims for $3.75B revenue by 2030, but faces risks.","url":"https:\/\/www.benzinga.com\/analyst-ratings\/analyst-color\/24\/11\/41986341\/what-is-plug-powers-future-analysts-warn-of-cash-crunch-and-slow-hydrogen-market-growth","published_at":"2024-11-14T21:48:38Z","content":"Analysts revised the price target or estimates on Plug Power, Inc. PLUG after the company reported weak third-quarter results and provided FY25 guidance. On Wednesday, Plug provided its financial outlook for 2025, projecting revenue between $850 million and $950 million (street view: $1.185 billion).\u00a0 Looking further ahead, the company aims for a target revenue of approximately $3.75 billion by 2030. Also this week, Plug Power reported third-quarter revenue of $173.73 million, which missed the consensus of $210.23 million and EPS loss of 25 cents, missed estimate for a loss of 24 cents. The company expects its full-year 2024 revenue outlook\u00a0of $700 million and $800 million\u00a0versus estimates of $823.46 million. Piper Sandler analyst Kashy Harrison cut the price target to $1.40 from $1.60 while maintaining an Underweight rating. The analyst writes that Plug\u2019s results missed expectations but weren\u2019t as weak as anticipated. While cash burn improved year-over-year, it remains high, requiring continued capital raises despite potential DOE loan support for Texas CapEx (annualized OCF: -$700 million). The rationale for U.S. grid-tied green hydrogen projects is unclear due to power shortages, though European development may benefit from government support, adds the analyst. Thus, the analyst estimates fourth-quarter revenues at $193 million, below the Street\u2019s $280 million estimate. JP Morgan analyst Bill Peterson maintained a Neutral rating on the stock. The analyst writes that he found the more cautiously optimistic tone refreshing, with an acknowledgment that the broader hydrogen industry is likely to see gradual growth in the near- to mid-term. Plug\u2019s goals to achieve EBITDA-positive in second half of FY26 and profitability by 2028 still suggest the need for additional capital raises\u2014estimated at $1 billion\u2014despite the DOE loan, given the company\u2019s fragile cash position, adds the analyst. The analyst says that if the company executes well in 2025, it could pave the way for a stronger 2026 and growth in the latter part of the decade, contingent on factors like the DOE loan closure and final 45V guidance. Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew S Percoco reaffirmed an Underweight rating with a price target of $1.75. The analyst maintains a cautious outlook on green hydrogen, which presents ongoing risks to the company\u2019s long-term growth and margins. Percoco estimates that PLUG will need to issue an additional $500 million in equity through the first half of FY25 to cover its near-term cash burn, with DOE funding expected to start in the second quarter of 2025. Roth analyst Craig Irwin reiterated the Buy rating and a price target of $5.00, with a 2025 revenue estimate of $900 million. This reflects the successful generation of Green Hydrogen PTC in Georgia and the improving visibility of gross margin gains in second half of FY25. PLUG\u2019s shares may experience increased volatility due to the high valuation on 2025 estimates, with company-specific and industry catalysts potentially causing significant shifts in long-term hydrogen economy projections, adds the analyst. With a Perform rating, Oppenheimer analysts write that they view Plug\u2019s commentary on green ammonia pricing as positive for electrolyzer demand and see the cryogenic business benefiting from LNG growth. The analyst says that they are encouraged by PLUG\u2019s focus on operational efficiencies, given its cash position, and notes investors are seeking greater consistency in its financial performance. Truist Securities analyst Jordan Levy maintained a Hold rating with a price target of $2. The analyst writes that the updated targets suggest a more grounded reset of expectations. It appears PLUG is shifting from a pattern of overpromising and underdelivering, acknowledging the slower-than-anticipated hydrogen market growth and tighter capital environment, adds the analyst. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via\u00a0Global X Hydrogen ETF HYDR. Price Action: PLUG shares are down 3.30% at $1.905 at the last check Thursday.

Diverse teams outperform homogeneous ones in profitability by 36%.","url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/karadennison\/2024\/11\/14\/the-benefits-of-neurodiversity-in-leadership\/","published_at":"2024-11-14T18:20:09Z","content":"The benefits of neurodiverse leaders Despite making up 15-20% of the global population, neurodivergent individuals, those with autism, ADHD, dyslexia, or other cognitive variations, remain severely underrepresented in leadership roles, even though there are major benefits to having neurodiversity among leadership positions. This gap is even more pronounced for neurodivergent women, who often go undiagnosed and face unique barriers to advancement. Recent data from the UK's Office for National Statistics highlights only 22% of autistic individuals being employed. Additionally, 50% of UK managers admitted they won\u2019t hire neurodivergent individuals. Those employed don\u2019t get their desired positions, as they\u2019re wrongly assumed to be only qualified for specialist, subordinate, or isolated roles within their companies. Yet, organizations that embrace neurodivergent leaders are discovering significant competitive advantages. A report by McKinsey & Company shows diverse teams outperform homogeneous ones in profitability by 36%, and neurodivergent leaders bring distinct strengths that drive innovation and growth. Neurodivergent conditions like autism and ADHD have long been associated with males, but recent numbers highlight neurodivergence in both sexes. Nearly 80% of autistic females remain undiagnosed by age eighteen. As a result of this lack of understanding, the neurodivergent traits present in women are missed or masked for decades. This explains why boys are diagnosed with ADHD at a three-to-one ratio compared to girls and are four times more likely to be diagnosed with autism and twice as likely to be diagnosed with dyslexia. In addition, current diagnostic tools for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are built around male behavioral patterns, leaving many girls and women to manage their conditions without proper diagnosis or support. There\u2019s a large gap between the lived experience of neurodivergent women leaders and the perceptions of those experiences held by neurotypical people. For instance, some leaders have been thought to have character flaws when, in reality, they\u2019re struggling with an unrecognized aspect of their neurodivergence. The pattern repeats the more successful women become, including CEOs, who have had their concerns dismissed by doctors based on the assumption that professional success rules out neurodivergence. These cases point to the business world's failure to recognize neurodivergence in women. When women exhibit traits including intense focus, direct communication, or unique organizational patterns, they are often criticized or prevented from getting the support they need. Despite the misjudgment neurodivergent women encounter in the workplace, they bring distinct advantages to leadership roles when supported. These advantages translate to value that will benefit the business in the long run. There are instances where traits like ADHD enable professionals to process multiple situations simultaneously and spot potential outcomes others may miss. What gets labeled as scattered thinking in meetings often masks an ability to manage multiple complex challenges simultaneously, a crucial skill in today's fast-paced business environment. EY's internal studies in 2023 found that teams with higher percentages of female partners achieve both higher revenues and margins. Through EY's 23 Neuro-Diverse Centers of Excellence globally, neurodivergent professionals have developed solutions resulting in millions of service provision hours saved and nearly $1 billion in value creation. Even major corporations are starting to recognize these advantages. JP Morgan Chase launched its Autism at Work program in 2015. It started as a five-person pilot program that saw remarkable success. Within six months, those first neurodiverse employees demonstrated 48% higher productivity than their neurotypical counterparts who had been at the company for three to ten years. The Autism at Work program has since expanded to hundreds of employees across 40 different roles in nine countries. Similar success stories have emerged from other major companies. SAP's Autism at Work initiative has achieved a 94% retention rate among neurodiverse employees. Goldman Sachs' Neurodiversity Hiring Initiative, launched in partnership with Specialisterne, achieved a 100% offer and acceptance rate in its first virtual class, demonstrating how these unique perspectives strengthen organizational capability. Neurodivergent leaders, especially neurodiverse women leaders, bring valuable perspectives and capabilities that enhance organizational performance. Their different ways of processing information, solving problems, and leading teams aren't just beneficial but are increasingly essential for success in a complex business environment. Organizations that recognize and support these unique capabilities will gain significant competitive advantages in innovation, efficiency, and team performance. Businesses need concrete strategies to create truly inclusive environments where neurodivergent professionals can thrive to benefit from the innovation these individuals can bring: A complete overhaul of traditional hiring processes is required. Standard interviews prioritizing social skills over technical abilities, skillsets, and experience often screen out talented neurodivergent candidates. Progressive companies are now implementing performance-based hiring methods that focus on practical skills and actual job requirements. This means: Success starts at the top. Companies showing real progress in neurodiversity inclusion have implemented specific leadership accountability measures. EY's approach of evaluating leaders on inclusive practices using standardized global metrics sets a clear standard for others to follow. Effective support systems include: Building a genuinely inclusive environment goes beyond formal policies. Companies need to create spaces where neurodivergent professionals feel safe being themselves. Key steps include: Many neurodivergent professionals face invisible barriers to advancement due to outdated leadership stereotypes. Businesses need to create clear, accessible paths for career growth that account for different working styles and strengths. This involves: Companies need concrete ways to measure their progress in neurodiversity inclusion. This isn't just about hiring numbers \u2013 it's about retention, advancement, and contribution. Effective measurement includes: The adage \u201cthis is how it\u2019s always been done\u201d is a great way for companies to stay small. Embracing neurodiversity within employees and leaders is a great way for organizations to grow, scale, and become top industry leaders. The companies that do, time and again, have excelled in productivity, innovation, risk reduction, retention, employee engagement, and revenue generation.  One Community.

(Photo By Piaras \u00d3 M\u00eddheach\/Sportsfile for Collision via Getty Images) Surveys are touting the \u201chigh adoption rates\u201d of AI in small businesses. But this is just hype. Most of my clients aren't really using AI like their much larger counterparts. But that will change in 2025. Thanks to a wave of forthcoming AI agents, small businesses will finally be able to start automating with AI like big companies are doing. While corporate brands like Klarna, T-Mobile, UBS Warburg and JP Morgan are spending millions to create large language models that can do everything from completing customer service inquiries, listening in on customer interactions, transacting investment purchases and behaving like human wealth managers, small businesses this year have been mostly tinkering around with generative AI chat bots like ChatGPT and Claude or toying with Microsoft Copilot and Google's Gemini for Workspace to help them write better emails or answer basic questions. In 2024, the AI story was big businesses building big AI applications. That\u2019s because smaller companies can\u2019t afford to build. But in 2025 things will change. Instead of building their own applications, a wave of AI-enabled software will be available for smaller companies that will far surpass the capabilities of the chat bots we\u2019re now using. They\u2019re called AI agents. An AI agent takes generative AI to the next level. It doesn't just generate a response or an email or a document. It actually does something. It performs tasks. It initiates transactions. It fixes problems. It behaves like a human. Software companies large and small are investing in AI agents to enhance their offerings. Why? Because they understand that these are the types of features that will help their customers increase productivity and profitiability. More importantly, they\u2019re competing with each other to offer the kinds of tools that will keep their customers paying their monthly subscription fees. Good for them. And good for us. Microsoft, for example, is rolling out ten agents for its Dynamics 365 customers. These \"assistants\" will better qualify leads by conversing with prospects, confirm sales and purchase orders, reconcile invoices in one ledger to cash receipts in other, approve expenses, resolve issues, close tickets and schedule field service agents. The company plans \"many more agents\" in the coming year. CRM giant Salesforce is introducing SDRs (sales development representatives) and Einstein Coach agents that will also qualify leads before a human interacts, schedule meetings, and then offer a video likeness of a person resembling the lead to help the salesperson rehearse their pitch through role-playing and by providing competitiveness analysis before actually conversing with their actual human target. According to the company, the \"SDR gets you meetings, the coach helps you get better at your pitch.\" According to Intuit, which dominates the small business accounting software world, it's soon-to-be-released agents will be \"bringing together the power of GenOS, the orchestrator, large language models, GenSRF (Security, Risk and Fraud), the UX experience, and it\u2019s tying all that with what people really want, which is the ability to have work done for them.\u201d Its financial agents will analyze a company's cash flow and then pay bills accordingly. Those same agents will digest and understand emails, documents and images to automatically process invoices and apply cash. In the healthcare world, chipmaker Nvidia announced voice-enabled AI agents that will assume the role of nurses at a much lower rate per hour. In the software development world, firms like You.com have raised money to offer their \"research\" and \"genius\" agents that can retrieve reports and solve complex problems and better understanding complex scientific concepts. For both consumers and small businesses both Anthropic and Google have announced new agents that can literally take over a device and then perform various tasks like web browsing, button clicking and text input to perform anything that an employee does (i.e. \"book a flight on this day and this time\" or \"order more office supplies\" or \"submit a customer service complaint\") on a single command. In 2025 small businesses won't just be using AI to \"generate\" a response to their queries. They'll be leaning on AI agents to actually do something with that information. The big worry, as always, is people. Although none of these companies will publicly admit it, their agents are doing the tasks that humans are doing which obviously means that less humans will be needed. There is a great fear among employees that AI is going to replace them and that they\u2019re going to lose their jobs. This is a legitimate fear. For a business owner who's already facing labor shortages and struggling to increase their company's output and meet their customers' demands without increasing their overhead, agents will be useful. In an economy challenged by demographic declines and immigration hurdles, they're a Godsend. And until these agents are paired with technology like Google's Project Astra and robotics made by companies like Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics, warehouse workers are still going to be in high demand. But that won\u2019t take too long \u2013 probably a couple of years. Should employees be concerned? Only the ones who don't embrace this stuff to make themselves more valuable. AI is like any other technology. It\u2019s a productivity tool. But business owners have a responsibility to allay this fear by providing training and helping employees understand its benefits. The reality is that agents are finally going to start moving AI from the corporate boardroom to Main Street this year. It won't happen immediately. They won't work as well as promised (when does a new technology ever?). But rest assured that, like the cloud, mobile apps and other technologies, our software providers will be pushing their customers to use their agents and my smartest clients will do just that. What should small business owners be doing right now? That\u2019s easy: talking to their software vendors about AI agents. While big companies are building their own internal AI driven applications, the tech industry is investing hundreds of millions building similar functionality for their customers. It\u2019s up to us to understand these capabilities, learn them and apply them to our businesses in 2025.  One Community.

But his health policy proposals are making them nervous.","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/healthcare-investors-torn-on-trump-second-term-2024-11","published_at":"2024-11-09T11:00:02Z","content":"Some healthcare-focused VCs are torn about what Donald Trump's presidential win could mean for their portfolios. Six healthcare investors expressed mixed feelings about Trump's win \u2014 largely rooted in a tension they feel between the potential for big deals to come back and policies that fear could restrict healthcare access to many patients. Trump could make sweeping changes to healthcare policy in his return to the presidency. He's said he'll let Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \"go wild\" on health initiatives in the new administration, which could see the former presidential candidate making good on his desires to ban fluoride from public water systems, \"get toxins out of our food,\" and inject vaccine skepticism into federal decisionmaking, among other initiatives. While Trump is unlikely to\u00a0try again\u00a0to repeal the Affordable Care Act, he may seek to boost Medicare Advantage plans, cut Medicaid spending, and\u00a0reorganize federal agencies, from the Food and Drug Administration to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to an interview Kennedy Jr. gave from Trump's Florida estate shortly after the election. After a three-year IPO desert for digital health startups, healthcare investors are desperate for the exit opportunities that a second Trump presidency could usher in. But some of Trump's proposed health policy moves are making investors nervous about their potential impacts on startups building in care areas like women's health and Medicaid, as well as on doctors and patients. Compared to Trump's first term, \"I think you're going to see a more systemic overhaul of the infrastructure that administers our healthcare system, and that could happen relatively quickly,\" said Michael Greeley, cofounder and managing partner of Flare Capital Partners. \"It's the unknown of those moves that makes it really hard to make a long-term investment decision.\" In the three years since 2021's healthcare funding boom \u2014 during which 21 healthcare startups went public \u2014 only four digital health startups have gone public in total, with mixed success. A number of healthtech startups have been waiting on the sidelines for their chance to IPO \u2014 and Trump's election should boost their odds, healthcare investors told BI. The lower corporate taxes and deregulation a second Trump term could promise are already amplifying public market optimism. A number of tech and finance giants, from Tesla to JP Morgan Chase, saw their stocks soar Wednesday morning. By midday Friday, the S&P 500 index had risen 3.6% from Tuesday's close. Some startups, including physical therapy startup\u00a0Hinge Health\u00a0and diabetes startup\u00a0Omada Health, have already signaled their intentions to IPO when the digital health markets reopen. Several other late-stage startups are moving towards the exits, too. Maven replaced its chief financial officer in October with an executive with public market experience, BI reported. Sword Health has said it's planning to IPO as soon as the second half of 2025. The healthcare M&A market looks ripe for more activity. Big deals could be on the horizon, including the proposed mega-merger of health insurance rivals Cigna and Humana. Bloomberg reported in October that the insurers had resumed talks of combining after previously shelving the deal last December. The Cigna-Humana merger was expected to face significant antitrust scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission, led by Lina Khan since 2021. She could be removed as the FTC's head early in Trump's second term \u2014 and with relaxed M&A regulations, \"anything is possible,\" said What If Ventures founder Stephen Hays. Investors said they also expect to see increased private equity involvement in healthcare through more investments and acquisitions. Healthcare VC has been calling for consolidation in overcrowded areas of healthcare like behavioral health for years. Additional interest rate cuts could help facilitate PE-backed mergers, or even rollups of multiple solutions, in the many fragmented areas of digital health and healthcare services, said a Boston-based healthcare investor. While healthcare investors remain optimistic about what a second Trump term could mean for late-stage startups, VCs said his win could have consequences for key areas of the industry. Reproductive rights remained a top concern throughout the election cycle. Founders of women's health companies and their investors previously expressed concerns to Business Insider about what a second Trump term could mean for their businesses. While Trump has said he wouldn't sign off on a national abortion ban, experts have raised worries that the president-elect could impose more restrictions on birth control access and abortion pills delivered by mail. Demand for abortion pills, emergency contraception, and related treatments exploded on Wednesday as patients rushed to stockpile the drugs in fear of potential restrictions. In the wake of the election, women's health investors are dismayed but hopeful that the sector will largely remain untouched by federal policy changes and that VCs will be able to use their capital to push care forward even in the face of policy threats. \"In our conversations with others, there is a shared resoluteness to continue to pledge investment and develop innovation in historically underfunded categories (e.g. contraception & abortion access, menstruation & hormonal health, maternal health & fertility, menopause & aging),\" said Carli Sapir, the founding partner of Amboy Street Ventures, in an email to Business Insider. \"Every dollar and ounce of effort toward these areas now speaks volumes for future impact.\" Medicaid could also be targeted in Trump's second term. Experts think Trump could cut Medicaid funding and enable states to refuse to expand their Medicaid coverage. Those changes could impact dozens of startups innovating in Medicaid, as well as the millions of patients covered under Medicaid plans, said Jordan Nof, a cofounder and managing partner at Tusk Venture Partners. And if the House of Representatives goes red along with the Senate, experts expect the subsidies that help people pay for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act to disappear after they expire at the end of 2025. Without those subsidies, tens of millions of people will see their premiums significantly increase, potentially making coverage prohibitively expensive for many. If fewer patients can afford to be insured, the healthcare system is certain to see rising spend associated with increased hospitalizations from otherwise avoidable health problems \u2014 a consequence with far-reaching implications across healthcare and the companies building in the sector. Trump's victory could have a positive impact on several big areas of healthcare investment. For one, Trump is expected to restrict the government's involvement in AI regulation. That means AI companies, including healthcare AI companies, will keep soaring with fewer guardrails. Without federal AI safety efforts, the healthcare industry will likely move to self-regulate new technologies, especially in more contentious areas like clinical decision support, Flare Capital Partners' Greeley said. Some of those efforts are already underway, including by groups like the Coalition for Health AI, which includes top academic medical centers like Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins Speaker alongside tech companies like Microsoft. Still, \"there'll be temptations around the margins to more rapidly deploy technologies that aren't yet determined to be safe,\" Greeley said. Medicare Advantage plans are also expected to be boosted by a returning Trump administration that's likely to move to further incentivize commercial health insurance. That could be good for the few young insurers clamoring for market share in Medicare Advantage, like Devoted Health and Alignment Healthcare, and the many startups working to improve payment processes between insurers and providers. (An increased share of Medicare Advantage plans in the Medicare market might not be good for patients, however, since Medicare Advantage plans deny claims more frequently than traditional Medicare.) And while Robert F. Kennedy Jr's potential appointment to a key health role in the Trump administration worries some healthcare experts, his focus on \"food as medicine\" could yield some interesting federal projects and perhaps add momentum to the nutrition startups gaining traction, said Chrissy Farr, a managing director at Manatt, Phelps and Phillips, and a general partner at Scrub Capital. \"He's been given carte blanche, apparently, to take this on. Coupled with GLP-1s, I could see America really doing something interesting around food in the next couple of years,\" Farr said.

This is a lightly edited transcript of the accompanying video from professor Peter St. Onge. The Wall Street Journal is speculating that President-elect Donald Trump may fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Powell says he won\u2019t go. Can the president fire a Fed chief? And if not, who is actually running the Fed? Trump appointed Powell in 2017, and has pretty much been at war with him ever since. Powell was appointed on the recommendation of his friend Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, a former hedge funder. Powell himself is not actually an economist\u2014he worked in private equity, which normally buys up companies and sells them for parts. But Powell worked for a conspiracy theorist\u2019s fever dream, the Carlyle Group, featured in \u201cFahrenheit 9\/11\u201d as the crony poster child of the military industrial complex. It\u2019s a big club. And Trump was new to the game. At any rate, just nine months in, Trump already wanted Powell gone, because Powell was raising interest rates when inflation was two-and-a-half points. Higher rates slow growth, and Trump had promised growth. Once COVID-19 hit, of course, rates went to zero, so it was moot. Fast-forward to today, with Trump musing during the campaign that rates are too high, which is strangling the economy and squeezing families. Of course, Powell is doing this because the alternative is to control inflation by cutting government spending. So, can Trump fire Powell and get the Fed chairman of his dreams? Presidents can\u2019t outright fire Fed chairs unless it\u2019s for cause\u2014meaning, they\u2019re corrupt or go to Diddy parties. But they can demote them to regular Fed governors, who have less power. But that requires an open seat, which doesn\u2019t happen until early 2026\u2014a few months before Powell\u2019s term as chair ends anyway. Of course, Congress could always create an open seat by packing the Fed. In which case Trump could demote Powell today and appoint a new chair. So, he sort of can. But \u2026 should he? There\u2019s the surface question: Should rates go lower? That depends how far away we are from recession and whether \u201cTrumponomics\u201d will head off that recession. But the more important question is, why do we have a system where Fed chairs can\u2019t be fired? After all, we live in a republic where politicians are the voice of the voters. If a Fed chair is independent of presidents, it means he is independent of voters. In which case, who exactly does the Fed answer to? JP Morgan? Citigroup? Indeed, former Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, has pointed out the Fed has less oversight than the CIA. Fed chairs can and do refuse to answer oversight questions from Congress, which would obviously get a CIA director fired\u2014something presidents very much can do. This is, incidentally, true of all modern central banks. They are intentionally set up to be independent of voters\u2014allegedly because voters like inflation, but possibly because the purpose of a central bank is to print money and hand it to bankers, governments, big corporations, and rich people. None of which would be very popular with voters. In fact, voters might shut it down\u2014the money printing and the central bank. So, what\u2019s next?  Whether or not Powell sticks around, the fight raises an important question why, precisely, our economy is manipulated by a private corporation\u2014the Fed\u2014that\u2019s not only unconstitutional, but explicitly does not answer to voters. Government shouldn\u2019t be manipulating the economy in the first place. But doing it independent of voters amounts to an economic occupation. We publish a variety of perspectives.

A survey conducted last year by the central bank found that only 7% of people use cash when making purchases. Ninety percent of the survey\u2019s respondents said they pay for their groceries with a card or mobile payment app. However, Heikkinen says that now is not a good time to give up cash completely, given the rising risk of attacks against Finnish infrastructure, including its payments system: \u201cMore payment methods bring resilience. If a single payment method sometimes does not work, then we have other payment methods at our disposal. Cash still plays a very important role here.\u201d It seems that more and more central banks in Europe are rediscovering one of the beauties of cash: its resilience. It won\u2019t fail in a power cut or seize up during a cyber attack (although, of course, ATMs might). As Brett Scott, author of Cloudmoney: Cash, Cards, Crypto and the War for our Wallets, notes , any society that runs purely on digital platforms operated by large financial institutions \u201cis going to have major resiliency problems.\u201d \u00a0 Role of Ukraine Conflict To reinforce Finland\u2019s payments system, the Bank of Finland has recommended that the use of cash payments be guaranteed by law. In March 2022, the bank initiated a proposal for legislation to ensure a minimal level of cash-paid services. But it\u2019s not only the central bank that appears to be re-evaluating its approach toward cash: so, too, is the general public, with 95% of citizens considering it crucial for cash to continue serving as a valid payment method alongside digital alternatives, according to a 2023 survey by IRO Research for Nosto ATMs. The war in Ukraine and Finland\u2019s recent membership of NATO appear to have played a role in this shift. According to the survey, the conflict in Ukraine and concerns about supply security have affected the attitude of nearly one-third (28%) of Finns towards cash. \u201cCash usage, especially in the context of supply security, is fundamentally tied to social responsibility,\u201d said Risto Lepo, Country Manager of Nosto ATMs. \u201cNot every Finn has access to bank cards or digital services. Historically, societal upheavals often lead to an increased reliance on cash. The conflict in Ukraine underscored the importance of supply security, prompting Finns to consider multiple payment methods as a prudent approach.\u201d A similar phenomenon has occurred in Sweden and Norway. As we reported in mid-October, the government and central bank of Norway, one of Europe\u2019s most cashless economies, are now seeking to slow or even reverse the mass abandonment of cash. Only 3% of Norwegians used cash in their latest purchase in a physical shop, according to a recent central bank survey. In a bid to change that, a new amendment to Norway\u2019s Financial Contracts Act came into force on October 1 that bolsters citizens\u2019 rights to pay with cash in retail settings. Earlier this year, the world\u2019s oldest bank, Sweden\u2019s Riksbank, cautioned about the unintended consequences of rapidly driving cash out of the economy. In its 2024 payments report, it warned of \u201cserious fraud problems that could undermine trust in the payment system.\u201d Digitalisation, it said, also makes payments \u201cmore vulnerable to cyber attacks and disruptions to the power grid and data communication,\u201d adding that these developments suggest \u201cwe should concentrate more than before on the challenges of digitalization.\u201d* Since then, The Daily Telegraph has reported that criminals in Sweden are \u201chaving a field day\u201d after the country\u2019s mass abandonment of cash. Around the same time, Fortune magazine ran an article titled \u201cGoing Cashless Has Turned Sweden from One of the Safest Countries into a High-Crime Nation.\u201d The country\u2019s central bank now wants to reverse course, and has called on the government to adopt urgent measures to strengthen cash\u2019s role as a means of payment. Late last year, the central bank echoed a point we have been making for a number of years: \u201cit is not enough to simply take measures to strengthen the availability of cash through withdrawal requirements and new depots, it must also be usable.\u201d \u201cCash Under the Mattress\u201d The latest European central bank to sound the alarm is the Dutch National Bank (DNB), which in late October highlighted the rising threat posed to the financial system by artificial intelligence, surging cybercrime and system outages. Cyberattacks against the financial sector account for roughly one-quarter of all attacks and can, in extreme cases, \u201cmake financial services temporarily unavailable\u201d across the country\u2019s entire financial system, the central bank wrote in its financial stability report.\u00a0 In the Netherlands, like everywhere in Europe and most parts of the world, cash use has fallen sharply over the past decade.* Between 2019 and 2022, it was the second country in the Euro Zone where access to cash worsened the most. From Cash Essentials: Per the European Central Bank\u2019s (ECB)\u00a02022 SPACE study, the Netherlands is the penultimate euro-area country by volume of cash payments after Finland. Cash has the lowest share of person-to-person payments in the\u00a0euro\u00a0area. Dutch consumers had the lowest cash holdings, with \u20ac46. Cash services and infrastructure have shrunk, particularly after the three major banks \u00a0(ABN AMRO, ING, and Rabobank) merged their ATMs into the Geldmaat joint venture in 2019. ATMs for withdrawing cash declined 29.1%, from 7,226 in 2018 to 5,122 in 2023; recirculating ATMs combining withdrawal and deposit functions shrank 34.2%, from 2,960 in 2018 to 1,948 in 2023 (CPA Memorandum\u00a02024: While Dutch cash use has declined in the aggregate, 1.3-1.5 million Dutch people depend on cash in their daily transactions, according to a rough 2020 estimate by\u00a0McKinsey\u00a0(CPA Policy Compass\u00a02024: 1c). In\u00a02022, 13% of Dutch consumers reported cash was their preferred\u00a0payment instrument; a plurality (46%) consider having the option to pay with cash very or fairly important. The Netherlands has already suffered two large payment outages in the past 15 months, not to mention the fallout from the global Crowdstrike meltdown. In August 2023, a nationwide outage made it prevented stores from being able to process many debit card payments. Problems with ATMs were also reported. Then, on May 16 and 18 of this year, another outage struck retail payment systems, with more than a third of PIN-based payments affected. This time, ATMs were unaffected, providing a vital lifeline for citizens and businesses. However, DNB\u2019s monetary affairs chief Olaf Sleijpen recently told the Dutch financial newspaper Financieele Dagblad that people should not assume that payments system will always work: This could happen, for example, if the services of a number of large financial institutions were to go down at the same time, if several banks were to suffer financial damage at the same time or if customers were to lose confidence in the sector due to an incident. A bank\u2019s services can be out of service for a longer period of time and customers need to be prepared for this, says DNB director Olaf Sleijpen. \u201cLarge online attacks simply happen more often. Just look at the hack at the National Police (in which contact details of almost all police employees were stolen at the end of September, ed.) You have to take into account that you may not be able to pay by debit card for a longer period of time. Then you have to have cash under the mattress, or be able to pay with QR codes.\u201d\u2026 The biggest danger of bank hacks is that if one bank is hit, consumers lose confidence in the entire system, says Sleijpen. \u201cThis could lead to a run, which may lead to DNB having to block financial transactions. Then people can no longer access their money. You don\u2019t want that.\u201d Third-Party Risks The report also notes that the financial sector is increasingly vulnerable to incidents affecting third parties, as recently demonstrated by the Cloudstrike outage that caused millions of Microsoft systems around the world to crash, bringing the operating systems of banks, payment card firms, airlines, hospitals, NHS clinics, retailers and hospitality businesses to a standstill. Affected businesses were faced with a stark choice: go cash-only, or close operations until the systems came back online. The scale of the resulting disruption was so great that it even prompted some of the UK\u2019s largest newspapers, which had heretofore played a key supporting role in the War on Cash, to warn about the inherent fragility risks of a cashless society. In the wake of the outage, New Zealand\u2019s central bank, like an increasing number of central banks in Europe, recommended that citizens have some cash on hand in the case of future incidents. Since the Cloudstrike meltdown, outages have continued to plague banks, both large and small, around the world. On Sunday, the UK lender Natwest\u2019s banking app went down, leaving thousands of customers \u201cunable to access money\u201d for hours, reports The Mirror.\u00a0 In the US, two of the largest lenders, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America, have suffered significant outages in the past month. In the case of Bank of America, many of its customers complained that their account balances were not visible on the app while others reported seeing a balance of $0. It is a similar story down under.\u00a0Two of Australia\u2019s \u201cBig Four\u201d lenders, Westpac and Commonwealth Bank, have both suffered extensive problems with their online and mobile banking systems over the past month. In the case of Westpac, its banking services repeatedly became unavailable over a four-day period, leaving customers unable to transfer funds or payments. Days later, a systems error at Commonwealth Bank brought its banking app down. Some customers complained of having duplicate transactions taken out of their bank accounts \u2013 with many reportedly going overdrawn as a result. Australia has been so plagued with bank outages that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) began requiring banks to publish consistent figures on how reliable their services had been across areas such as branches, ATMs, websites, apps and card payments. The Optus meltdown last year resulted in the CEO\u2019s resignation, a parliamentary inquiry, and significant brand damage. The banks claim to be spending more on cybersecurity, yet while the number of outages has gone down the actual number of hours lost to outages remains unchanged. Bank outages are on the rise as a result of the complexity of ever more flexible and immediate banking services, the RBA recently conceded, noting that \u201conline banking and fast payments services are most likely to be affected from outages.\u201d Yet these are the exact same services and platforms the banking industry, including the RBA itself, has spent the past decade or so encouraging (to put it mildly) people to do all their banking with, while removing traditional options such as old-school branches and ATMs. Yet even as the outages persist, the RBA and Australian government appear to be doing precious little to help support public access to and use of cash. Meanwhile, in Europe the central banks of both Sweden and Norway have the unenviable task of trying to slow or even reverse the mass abandonment of cash they themselves helped set in motion. They will have their work cut out given that so much of the countries\u2019 cash infrastructure \u2014 in particular private banks\u2019 branch networks, ATMs and the distribution services offered by cash handling companies \u2014 has been allowed to wither over recent years. \u00a0 * There can be no doubt that we are living in a less cash world, with digital wallets now leading point-of-sale payments at 30% of transaction value, with credit cards second at 27%, debit cards third at 23% and cash fourth at 16%, according to the latest Global Payments Report by Worldpay. But it\u2019s far from a uniform picture. While countries like Sweden claim to have reached the outer limits of what is possible in their transition to becoming cashless societies, cash is still being used by billions of people worldwide. It is the leading payment method in twelve of the 40 markets examined by Worldpay: Argentina, Colombia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, the Philippines, Peru, Poland, Spain, Thailand and Vietnam. In Germany, cash is narrowly pipped at the post by debit cards, at 36 and 38% of payment value respectively. As the pressure group Cash Matters notes, in the current landscape, the strengths of cash continue to shine: \u201cbeing an \u2018always on\u2019 payment unaffected by network outages, supporting people with managing tight budgets, and providing privacy and competition as a not-for-profit payment method in a field of profit-making options.\u201d Truth is there have been so many EFTPOS outages across Europe in recent months and Bank systems exposed for the \u201changing by a thread\u201d many of the interfaces really are \u2013 cue Postbank in Germany and Commerzbank \u2013 but also in UK etc etc. Online banking via mobile App is so battery dependent at device level and system vulnerable at WiFi\/Internet level before you even reach the banking systems highly vulnerable architecture. Excellent survey of the current situation and am myself a believer in having cash at home aka reserves. As they said during the Great Depression, if you can\u2019t hold it you don\u2019t own it. Of course there is one aspect of all this that I do wonder about. Supposing that your banking goes down because the electrical grid goes down or the net goes down or any other of a myriad of causes. So what happens if you are suppose to pay a bill or debt or mortgage payment but you can\u2019t, even if it is to the bank that you own that money too? In a just system the bank or institution would waive any late fees but is this the way that it happens in practice? Or maybe a bank would levy those charges but before returning them in a sign of \u2018good will\u2019, put that accumulated money into the overnight money market. I know that some people will be shocked at the thought that a bank would be capable of such behaviour but it does happen. Credit cards originate in 1950 via Diners Club, so add in no potential of credit from afar during the Great Depression, as an added bonus. In the entertaining tome: The Great Depression: a Diary, Benjamin Roth relates in real time the goings on around Youngstown and nationwide for a decade starting in 1931, and banks were closing left and right, with your deposits unavailable to you, and the only way to get at them being to take real estate in exchange-not cash. He gave a breakdown of what you could get for your money in 1932 for the 6 or so closed banks in Youngstown, and it ranged from 45% to 65%, depending on what said banks had in real estate, as the sharpies of the day were buying it for 2-1 deal on their money. How scarce was money in say 1932? He bought a bushel of apples for 25\u00a2, and that\u2019s 125 apples. There\u2019s a lot to unpack here and it all will vary by institution, but for the most part this is how the institution I work at would operate\u2026 First the core banking data system would have its own back-up generator so if you had an automatic payment from your own deposit account to a loan at the same institution those automated transactions would still continue even if the data center was offline from the rest of the world, including external branches.  If the disaster was larger, there is a separate nearly mirrored disaster-recovery data center located in a different geographic location that would continue to operate as well and regular operations can be fully switch to it in fairly short order. If your payment is coming externally, it\u2019s likely coming via an ACH which means there is a file somewhere that just can\u2019t be delivered (in this scenario).  In this case a good FI like where I work would eventually get the file and it would be loaded and the transactions posted to the date we should have received the file which would prevent late fees from occurring. If you just couldn\u2019t make a manual payment because of this system outage, where I work I would suspect we would either systematically reverse the late fees or if it was easy or we knew it was going to be down for some time we\u2019d suppress the fees.  I don\u2019t know how many FI\u2019s would be this generous, but following events like Helen we have historically approved refunds in mass for customers in those disaster areas for late fees and even foreign ATM charges. Another example: floods in Valencia or in NC with long lasting cuts in electricity. Thanks for this post. Maybe they\u2019re watching Warren Buffett. Warren Buffett\u2019s War Chest Swells to a Record $325 Billion After Dumping More of 2 Key Positions. What Is the Billionaire Legend Planning? https:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-us\/money\/savingandinvesting\/warren-buffetts-war-chest-swells-to-a-record-325-billion-after-dumping-more-of-2-key-positions-what-is-the-billionaire-legend-planning\/ar-AA1tOYEk Ah yes, how the media refer to US oligarchs as \u201cbillionaire legends\u201d, \u201ctycoons\u201d, \u201cphilanthropists\u201d and not oligarchs, kleptocrats or sociopaths. Philanthropist has been \u201cstandardized\u201d term on WIkipedia since forever.

Even Jeffrey Epstein has philanthrophy mentioned on his page. Nothing can protect humanity from the love of all those philanthropists. I wonder if they have not been made aware of a planned outage in the not to distant future. Another informative article and comments, thanks for posting it.\nLike others here, and for the various reasons mentioned in the article, it is a very good idea to have some reserve cash on hand if possible, no matter what country. Also, some silver and gold coin might not be a bad idea either. Many people in the US, live check to check and don\u2019t really have that luxury.  I used to live in NL and I learned to speak fairly good Dutch; one phrase that comes to mind when reading about the vassal Nederlandse regiering: \u201cGodverdomme klootzaken!\u201d I hope I did not offend any Nederlanders. Speaking as a scrotal sac I find your comparison highly offensive. Speaking as an Afrikaner, daai balsakke praat \u2018n klomp stront. Gee, if only there was an easy to use, instantaneous, almost zero cost, international, divorced from the control of banks and governments, and, as a bonus, increasing in value (42% in the last month) payment method! Oh well, best keep some cash under the mattress and a bag of silver dimes buried in the back yard. If you\u2019re refering to bitcoin, its neither easy to use nor instantaneous and certainly not zero cost \ud83d\ude05 Not to mention that 42% deflation in one month doesn\u2019t make for a great currency. See how much your bitcoin will buy when the network goes down.\nHence, the very reason for this article. On the sweden online crime link: Banks should easily be able to track digital scammers since any operation has to be recorded in a database somewhere, i really don\u2019t understand why they let scammers or organized crime get away with it, it seems to me that they\u2019re just incompetent. Lordie, you are making economists\u2019 \u201cAssume a can opener\u201d look good.  Why don\u2019t you enlighten all of us as to how these transactions are traced to \u201cdatabases\u201d and how a bank gets the legal authority to get access to information in the hands of another private party which would have to expend time and money to cooperate, when it\u2019s not their problem?  On top of that, why do you assume the \u201cdatabase\u201d has anything to do with where the money winds up? Why do you assume that even finding the database tells you where the owner of the account is? What if the funds are sent offshore or to a company in a secrecy jurisdiction, where you can\u2019t find who the beneficial owners are?

Morgan Chase is focused on supporting the growth of companies along the Front Range of the Rockies by advising on commercial real estate (CRE) treasury operations to make organizations more efficient.\u00a0 While treasury departments can be overlooked by companies both large and small, Partner Insights spoke to Grace MacLeod, vice president and treasury management officer at J.P. Morgan Chase, who\u2019s working to change that dynamic. MacLeod, originally from New York City, now calls Denver home, bringing her big city hustle to this burgeoning Western town. Commercial Observer: What\u2019s an area of opportunity that fast-growing commercial real estate companies can improve to stay ahead?\u00a0 Grace MacLeod: Many newer commercial real estate companies are in the process of sophisticating their treasury operations. Real estate companies have aggressive growth goals, are focusing on raising funds and deploying capital, but may not be looking at their operations. It\u2019s easy to overlook the treasury department until it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a need for more investment.\u00a0 As companies scale up, we advise reviewing the processes they have in place including how they are leveraging their enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, if they are using a treasury management workstation, and how they are evaluating their overall cash management structure. We can assist them in developing a blueprint for integrating technology into their business, with a focus on automating certain elements of their operations.\u00a0 What are the primary challenges commercial real estate companies face in their treasury operations? These businesses work with extreme volumes and they need corporate, property operating, and security deposit accounts opened in a quick and efficient manner. Oftentimes a treasury team is the last to know of a deal closing, and there\u2019s the need to execute quickly, which can be challenging for a company that operates with complexity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Joint-venture partnerships are prevalent in the commercial real estate space, so effective communication between the partners is vital. That means working together to ensure that everything is being set up correctly, appropriate entitlements and systems are in place so that their funds are being managed correctly.\u00a0 Operating risk can permeate every internal process within an organization, especially when handling money that\u2019s not yours, which is common in real estate. Technology risk shows up via an ever-growing rise in payment fraud. Cyberattacks now represent real costs to a business, especially in companies with fragmented infrastructure. Liquidity risk comes with higher interest rates that impact how companies are managing and optimizing their cash levels and investment options.\u00a0 At what point do you typically see management recognizing the need to sophisticate their treasury operations? When the complexity of their existing processes or infrastructure becomes inefficient and starts to invite more risk in the three categories listed above. Some firms are working with hundreds of accounts across multiple banks and ERPs due to acquisitions of different business lines.\u00a0 Using different systems that don\u2019t talk to each other is a common issue. ERPs that aren\u2019t connected to banks, or are not as automated as they could be, is another pain point. All these problems create more manual processes, which makes it difficult to keep up with rigorous reporting standards. How do inadequate treasury reporting standards impact a commercial real estate company\u2019s ability to operate? Commercial real estate companies showing strong growth are typically bringing in institutional capital that requires a higher standard of reporting. Creating monthly or daily cash positions manually in an Excel worksheet is extremely cumbersome. Dealing with individual bank portals and constantly pulling reports hinders how effective a company can be in managing their cash.\u00a0\u00a0 Headcount is a critical consideration: Managing an ecosystem of 30 different banks with 500 different accounts requires significant resources. By investing in technology to centralize and aggregate data, a company can streamline operations and improve efficiency. How do sophisticated treasury systems and automated processes help build efficiencies? Companies want to make sure that transactions can be reconciled on an automated basis so that their reporting is current and accurate. This can be achieved by files sent directly from the bank into a company\u2019s ERP or treasury management workstation, significantly saving time reconciling payments.\u00a0 Leveraging those respective systems to improve true cash visibility across different banks allows companies to harness that data for intelligent forecasting so they can put idle cash to work. Having true visibility means adding more transparency into their operations. Ultimately, it helps a company deploy cash more effectively and simplifies reporting. What trends are you seeing in the ways commercial real estate companies are handling payment processing? When considering payment processing, companies are focusing on two distinct areas: the collection, storage and approval workflow, and the payment origination process itself. The collection and storage component in the vendor database is extremely important for a company if their ERP serves as their system of record. I usually ask them if they want to house and maintain that information. Some prefer a different arrangement.\u00a0 A lot of companies are focused on streamlining and automating the vendor onboarding process along with maintaining their ongoing vendor enrollment. Most companies want to have more influence on how vendors are paid.\u00a0 To optimize the process, companies are focused on converting payments from paper checks to automated clearing house (ACH) platforms or virtual cards so they can monetize their payments. They\u2019re reducing risk and complexity by lowering check volume while earning rebates on their annual spend. What are the long-term benefits for companies that invest in treasury operations, and how can they justify this investment to stakeholders? When speaking with clients, I often ask them about what they think is foundational to their success. Has their company invested in the technology that allows them to outperform their competitors? Have they invested in tools that help their company be more productive? The questions typically go to the top of the house, and the answers usually provide the justification for making the move.\u00a0 Automation can increase satisfaction levels within staff roles. If they\u2019re not focused on mundane tasks, they can concentrate on ensuring quality and improving their process. It\u2019s important to make the case that these investments yield real results, not only improving the bottom line, but also affording team members more time back for those value-added tasks that help improve overall productivity and profitability.

People like Paul Tudor Jones and Elon Musk keep talking about how we\u2019re going broke but what is the catalyst for an actual crisis here? There seem to be two extreme views when it comes to government debt levels. One is the view that government debt doesn\u2019t really matter all that much since we have the global reserve currency and the ability to print as much of that currency as we\u2019d like. The other view is that government debt levels are reaching a tipping point that will lead to calamity. I rarely think in extremes and believe a more nuanced view makes more sense on topics like this. It is true that U.S. government debt is enormous: Total government debt in the United States was around $23 trillion heading into the pandemic so debt levels are up 50% or so this decade alone. It\u2019s also true that the interest we pay on government debt has risen considerably because we\u2019ve taken on so much and interest rates are so much higher than they were in the 2010s: The big worry is the interest expense will grow so large over time that it will crowd out spending that could be used elsewhere. Here\u2019s a useful breakdown from JP Morgan that shows the federal budget: Interest expense makes up roughly the same amount as defense spending. Entitlements (Social Security and Medicare\/Medicaid) still make up the bulk of the federal budget (46%) but interest expense is getting up there. One of the reasons government debt gets people so worked up is because the numbers are so large. $35 trillion is a lot of money! But you can\u2019t look at debt levels on their own. You have to think of them through the lens of a $30 trillion U.S. economy. Here is interest expense as a percentage of GDP: It\u2019s shot up considerably in recent years but it\u2019s still below 1990s levels. The Fed cutting interest rates should help on the margins. Here is government spending as a percentage of GDP: Spending was 45% of GDP during the pandemic. That was obviously unsustainable but things are now back to normal. This doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that we\u2019ve built up a ton of debt but it does put things into perspective. The thing you have to understand is the United States government does not operate like a household when it comes to debt. You pay your mortgage off over time and eventually retire that debt. The government\u2019s budget is not at all like a household budget. First of all, the government can print its own currency. That helps in a pinch and it\u2019s the main reason our government can\u2019t go broke. Inflation is the true constraint when it comes to politicians spending money. As long as the economy is growing, debt should be growing too. The same is true of consumer debt: I would be more worried if you told me government and consumer debt were down in the coming decades. That would mean something is seriously wrong with the economy. Debt grows because assets grow (remember government debt is an asset in the form of bonds for investors). Debt grows because the economy grows. Income grows. Prices grow. So of course debt will rise. You can nitpick about the ways in which our politicians spend the money. No one is ever going to be completely satisfied on that front. There are certainly areas where the government can cut back and become more efficient. But as long as the pie keeps growing it makes sense the debts will grow too. Your biggest long-term worry about government spending should not be a day of reckoning where there\u2019s some magic level that causes a financial crisis. The biggest worry about government spending is inflation risk. After living through the highest inflation in four decades, we now know rapidly rising prices are not politically beneficial. Our country isn\u2019t going broke, but the public hates inflation so much that it could act as the biggest constraint in the years ahead when it comes to tackling government spending. Cullen Roche joined me on Ask the Compound this week to discuss this question: \ufeff We also talked about the impact of the deficit on the stock market, how tariffs work, the long-term trend of interest rates and how to fix government debt levels.

For example, the story of Michael Saylor microstrategy and bitcoin; the only reason that Michael Saylor really took it was because he had a real need for it; 500 million in cash, in kind of stagnant company\u2013 he needed to add vitality back to life to his company and corporation. Necessity is the true mother of all innovation. Similarly speaking, myself, moving here to LA, staring at this ridiculous high cost of living, and trying to find innovative ways to approach money, productivity time etc. I found bitcoin as almost a salvation for me, Cindy, my aging mom, Seneca, and my future family! So I think traditionally, most of us are stuck into the work cycle. It is a simple mathematical equation: a simple vector equation; \ufffcin goes your effort, time, and labor, the outcome and outflows are money and income. So for most people, there is directly proportional effect: You labor harder, more, and you yield more US dollars, and you work hard, put out new innovative product services etc., a lot of hard work and time, heavily market the thing, through genuine and effortful channels, and then wait diligently for somebody to purchase your products services workshops etc., hope they pay, and then when that dust settles within a month two or three, then you could withdraw that money from your PayPal or digital broker, and then deposited into your checking account, finally logging in and securing your \u201cgain\u201d. But, everything digitally we think about real wealth, how is it built accumulated etc.? Almost the opposite effect; the real rich people never have to labor for anything. You could be like Warren Buffett, just reading the newspaper and sitting on your bottom, and then your money, capital and investments magically go up, almost defying the laws of gravity, time, and friction, heat and physics?\ufffc So this is where things become funny: the notion of \u201cincome\u201d. Once again, I\u2019m still relatively new to all of this, in the sense that the average time labor, we have a hard time thinking like an investor. For example, to think that you just have $2 million in capital, you have some deep insight and intuition about something, \ufffcand then you invest that money into the thing, and then over the course of a few days weeks months, two months, three months, four months five months, a year, 4 to 5 years, the number magically goes up! To me, this is still like wizardry, like pure magic! And I still think this is where it is difficult to understand; to those who have access to capital, you essentially have an economic lever to lever up, and leverage that, which is just economic power and energy, to be even more more energy, more power. This is why it is true that let us say your grandparents bought a house in Beverly Hills like 50 years ago or 100 years ago, and your parents got married in that backyard in Beverly Hills, and then you got married in the same backyard, that is real generational wealth, the generational lever. \ufffc Just thinking consider let us say that I have 300 bitcoins, and then Seneca grows up and is like 36 years old, and he decides to have kids. Obviously when it is worth like $10 billion or something, \ufffc\ufffc and it just magically yields money, obviously he could continue to leverage that. And so can his kids kids kids. \ufffc So we hear stories of Warren Buffett, living the same old house, driving the old same Honda Accord whatever, and then just spending all day reading the newspaper investing in the markets, and then becoming like the third world\u2019s richest man, all at the age of 80 or 90 years old, but you\u2019re old sick fat and tired, still eating McDonald\u2019s and drinking Coca-Colas. Warren Buffett is not a good example. Even he was a skeptic and critic of bitcoin. I think the hard thing is everyone uses Warren Buffet as an example, but for my general sense, given the fact that he has invested heavily into Coca-Cola, he is no better than people who invest in fill up Morris evil cigarette and now vaping corporation, to spin a certain profit. The truth is everyone wants to be as rich as Warren Buffett but nobody actually wants to become Warren Buffett. Do you know anybody in the given universe who wants to be that old fat sick and unshapely? \ufffc Instead, I\u2019m much better idea is to be as jacked as King Leonidas, Gerald Butler in the movie 300, all while being a billionaire. My vision is essentially having the hard spartan body, naked and super fucking jacked, and also\u2026 this is the critical one; insanely Spartan and frugal, surprising everyone that you drive a Toyota Prius, even though you could afford like 200 cyber trucks. I think what I have discovered finally at the age of 36, is that with bitcoin, this changes everything. Why? Before bitcoin has finally hit mass adoption, and now that starting next year January 2025 will be a year one of bitcoin institutional adoption, \ufffcwhat that means is having a bitcoin is like having a cyber truck or Lamborghini on steroids, but on a digital wheel. \ufffc Bitcoin is the ultimate economic wheel!\ufffc This is my visual: I was at the park yesterday with Seneca, playing with him at night, just having the house key in my front pocket, no phone no nothing not even my camera, and we\u2019re just playing around in the tot lot, kicking around some bark, and I had the funny thoughts; would I trade a bitcoin for a Tesla? Maybe a cybertruck? But actually the other day I jumped into a cybertruck and I was a little bit underwhelmed; the funny thing about the cybertruck is that it looks so flashy and awesome from the outside, but on the inside once you actually step into it, it is a bit underwhelming; it doesn\u2019t really feel that different from sitting inside a Honda Accord or a Toyota Camry. Maybe it would be different if you were homeless and just owned a cybertruck and just slept in the trunk bed, but beyond this, I think cyber truck is one of those funny things that you could just admire it from the outside, without actually having to own it. \ufffcAnd if anything, the real thing to just wait for or save up for is the cybertaxi, which could just shuttle your kid to baseball practice, or take your wife directly to campus or work through the grueling 405 morning commute traffic. Anyways, now, my calculus is simple; I think of everything in context to bitcoin. For example, whenever I critically look and asses these things, I think to myself, How many bitcoins could I buy with this thing? \ufffc\ufffc For example I was just trolling around with the finance calculator for the Tesla website, and still the cheapest Tesla model 3, base edition, after taxes and even after the federal rebate, will still run you around $40-$45,000 out the door. And no this is the cheapest version! This is like half a bitcoin or a third of a bitcoin. I\u2019d rather take the bitcoin which is going to $13 million, rather than the Tesla car which is going to zero. A new line of thinking I\u2019ve also been thinking about is this general idea of accretive vs dilutive; \ufffcthat means, is this thing that I\u2019m interested in, will it increase value, a.k.a. go up in value, or go down in value? Obviously bitcoin is gonna continue to increase in value because more people find it to be valuable. Volatile doesn\u2019t mean risky. So I think now that Trump is president, bitcoin at this point is in my mind, practically 100% cemented and certain to go up forever. However as I mentioned in my prior essay, the philosophy of volatility, to reach higher highs you gotta reach lower lows? So assuming that you just took snapshots every year, at random high points year over year, you will find that bitcoin is the insanely obvious choice. With enough hindsight, with enough 20-20 you can see and determine and ascertain that in fact, bitcoin is by far the winning bet, nearly a trillion-fold obvious decision!\ufffc It has insane volatility which means it goes up and down a lot, constantly, but the cool thing is that it will essentially go up forever! And this is like volatility, it is like having a hypercharger or a supercharger in your engine; more power or more velocity, more extremes to reach higher performance. For example if you think about the velocity of a roller coaster; what makes it fun is precisely the highs and lows. If you take one of those boring kid ones, which is pretty much steady, it is insanely boring. Why? The thrills of the roller coaster\u2013 once again we are the adrenaline junkies! \ufffcOK\u2026 if you want the ultimate blend of safety with high-yield, my suggestion is 90% of your capital into bitcoin, \ufffc and 10% into microstrategy stock (MSTR). This is what I personally do. Why? Essentially you could treat microstrategy stock like your cash; it keeps going up in value, and actually in fact goes up quicker than bitcoin; although it is a security, a stock that you don\u2019t really \u201cown\u201d, like bitcoin which is digital property. Bitcoin is the first thing you could truly own. \ufffc I love Michael Saylor and microstrategy to death, I have like literally watched and listen to every single Michael Saylor podcast interview available out there, I also read his book the mobile wave, and I\u2019ve tried to consume every single piece of literature or thing that Michael Saylor has put out there. I also watched his recent earnings call, and watching it all in all, almost like watching a rockstar. However at the end of the day once again, the name of the game is to accumulate and acquire more bitcoins. He or she with the most bitcoins, or the entity with the most bitcoins shall win. So a simple thought to the Trump bitcoin administration and beyond; First, America must be the bitcoin leader. We must be the nation with the most bitcoin in our treasury reserves. Sent you the basic ideas like we are creating the next bitcoin Fort Knox; we must dominate every other nation in terms of the number of our bitcoin holdings, kind of like imagine military power, but bitcoin as cyber power. For example let us assume that the US Navy has strategic military dominance over the planet. And let us assume that our military power is at least 10,000 X to that mainland China. So in theory in terms of numbers, America must supersede mainland China in our bitcoin holdings. By at least a factor of 10,000X. I think even Donald Trump joked that maybe we could even use some of our bitcoin to pay back our national debt? I think actually the more interesting strategy is we hoard our bitcoins forever, until the end of time, and instead, I don\u2019t know\u2026 Someone with some good economic wizardry could figure out how we could leverage our debt in intelligent ways so we could actually pay back our debt without having to sell bitcoin. And once again\u2026 I think this is the main idea on my mind right now \u2014 we can continue to accumulate bitcoin, stack bitcoin, etc., \ufffc and figure out how we leverage borrowing cheap money or debt from other banks entities, to make money? My has enjoy an interest; give me all your capital, and I will invest it and grow it for you! Eric@erickim.com So the reason why I think this is such a big deal is that finally, with bitcoin, we have finally crossed the chasm. What this means is finally, in the year 2024 and beyond, capital is finally cyber. What this means is next frontier of capital is practically infinite. \ufffc Let me explicate this a bit more on why this is such a big deal: So it looks like traditionally, the last frontier of making money and wealth was companies. Why? With technology, finally you were able to break free a little bit of physical limitations. For example, with Google Amazon Facebook etc., you were able to finally cross the digital divide which means that you could actually Feel all things in assets digitally, like digital advertisements digital value etc. Yet the different nuance is still\u2026 Capital was not yet in the digital realm. For example even though Amazon Facebook Google and the big tech companies could create value digitally through cyber space in cyber networks, there was no Internet native money or capital in which they could store their value. For example all the big companies, we\u2019re still reliant on JP Morgan Chase to custody their US dollars and field currency the treasury reserve assets etc. But starting January of next year 2025\u2026 This will all change.

And the reason why this is such a big deal is that if you think about it, if you store any of your money in US dollars, even for a few days or weeks or months or even a month, you\u2019re actually slowly bleeding value. For example, imagine like you have a lovely warm apartment, a perfect 73\u00b0. Imagine that if every hour, your apartment gets 1\u00b0 cooler and colder, that means that by the evening, it will be dropping from the 70s to the 60s to the 50s to the 40s to the 30s to the 20s, up until the point that it is uninhabitable.

It could well go down as \u2018The Election Year\u2019 of our lifetime.\u00a0 In the annals of political history, never before has such a large population voted in a single year to elect governments. Sixty four countries, plus the EU, voted this year \u2014 representing nearly 49 per cent of the global population of 8.1 billion.\u00a0 For India and the US, whose federal elections coincide every 20 years, it was a reversal of sorts. In 2004, India voted for a major change while the US saw continuum. In the 2024 elections, India preferred continuity while the US saw a major upset and change. While elections and economics may appear disparate elements, the economic policies of a nation are always a function of elected governments. The results, therefore, will be consequential for a long time to come. This year will also be remembered for policy changes or reversals by major central banks \u2014 from the most developed to emerging nations. The US Federal Reserve has cut rates twice so far, with the promise of another cut in December.\u00a0 The Swiss National Bank was the first to cut rates \u2014 three times so far and one more likely in December. The ECB and the Bank of England also went for a chop, alongside Bank of Canada and the central banks of Sweden and New Zealand.\u00a0 This looks like an uncoordinated but concerted action, where softening inflation and the risk of slowdown or hardlanding appear to be key drivers for policy decisions. China has been far too aggressive in its fiscal stimulus, as opposed to monetary moves. Bank of Japan diverged in its policy response.\u00a0 The most noteworthy of all, however, is what India\u2019s central bank adopted as its policy stance. India remains one of the few economies without a rate cut so far this year.\u00a0 After a prolonged pause (for the 10th consecutive time, the repo rate is unchanged at 6.5 per cent), the monetary policy committee (MPC) finally decided to move the policy stance needle to \u2018neutral\u2019 in its October sitting, which is seen primarily as a baby step towards likely easing if the war over inflation is won.\u00a0 The central bank\u2019s analogy of an elephant lurking in the woods significantly typifies the perception that inflation is the only unwelcome thorn in the scheme of things.\u00a0 The shift in stance to \u2018neutral\u2019, combined with a steady hangover of excess liquidity in the system, has driven overnight and short-term rates lower to the extent of being qualified as deemed rate cut.\u00a0 The average overnight Mumbai interbank offer rate (MIBOR) and the market repo overnight rate (MROR), which traded at the 6.7-6.8 per cent band between October 2023 and March 2024, is currently trading around the policy rate (6.5 per cent). This has sharply pushed down treasury bill rates. In times to come, floating rate loans could also dip.\u00a0 This will also go down as a watershed year in the debt market as India qualified to be included in several emerging market bond indices.\u00a0 The inclusion in the JP Morgan index in June was the first major achievement \u2014 this is likely to result in inflows of about $20 billion into the bond market.\u00a0 Further, the inclusion in Bloomberg\u2019s emerging bond index, FTSE Russel EM-GBI, from next year will go a long way in ensuring sustained forex inflows and a cap on yields and cost for the issuer, besides opening up the Indian markets for the savvy overseas investor. More than the flows, it is a positive commentary on the economic stability and fiscal control of the country. The immediate risk to our markets comes from the policy announcements of the new US President \u2014 which are expected to be expansionary and favouring targeted tariff barriers.\u00a0 Both moves can be inflationary and delay further rate cuts in major economies, as tax cuts and ultra-loose fiscal policies will lead to exploding fiscal deficits.\u00a0 Going by the recent statements of MPC members, the RBI\u2019s first rate move may wait until February 2025, if not in Q1 FY26. The rate-cut cycle is also expected to be shallow as a weaker rupee would be a deterrent against aggressive monetary easing. The rupee has held itself well against the dollar in the last few weeks, even as emerging market currencies have seen sharp weakness. This, however, needs to be seen against a $20 billion drop in reserves, which must have gone towards defending a weakening rupee. The key determinant of the rates market in India is the demand-supply factor. The borrowing calendar for the second half of FY25 is in line with budget estimates, although slightly higher than a year ago. With global rates remaining flat to lower over the medium term, Indian bond yields could trade with a softening bias. While, in the short run, US yields may have a steepening bias, which could feed into emerging market yields, the trend portends lower yields in FY26. With most of the uncertainties associated with political and policy developments having come to a pass, the future looks less uncertain and the focus should now shift to growth-centric measures.

By midday New York time, it had already broken record after record.\u00a0 Now, Bitcoin\u2019s price has already popped above $88,000 per coin, according to CoinGecko, after having shot up 10% in the past 24 hours. Over a seven-day period, the asset has jumped 30%.\u00a0 Some analysts told Decrypt that it still has a long way to go due to hype around the election and subsequent Trump trade.\u00a0 \u201cWe would argue that prices could rise further given we have a combination of positive political momentum, social media hype, a continuation of interest rate cuts and the prospects of Bitcoin becoming a strategic reserve asset in the U.S.,\u201d CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill said.\u00a0 He added that Bitcoin touching $100,000 sooner rather than later wasn\u2019t unlikely\u2014as such a target would reflect just 10% of gold\u2019s market share.\u00a0 President-elect Donald Trump managed to score a shock victory in a tight race against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris for the White House. He wooed Silicon Valley\u2014including the crypto industry\u2014during his campaign, promising to help make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet.\u201d\u00a0 This made him a favorite for those going long on the future prices of digital assets.\u00a0 Part of this is down to a more favorable regulatory climate for the industry going forward, Amberdata Director of Derivatives Greg Magadini told Decrypt\u2014especially with Trump saying he would replace current Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair, Gary Gensler.\u00a0 Magadini said that options traders were betting on Bitcoin hitting the $90,000 to $100,000 range within the next month.\u00a0 But he added: \u201cShould the market get there, we might see prices struggle, unless sentiment shifts further bullish.\u201d Meanwhile, CryptoQuant\u2019s Head of Research Julio Moreno told Decrypt that different valuation metrics were pointing to Bitcoin hitting $95,000 to $104,000 per coin.\u00a0 Mainstream financial institutions still think the asset has room to run, though: In a report last week, analyst at America\u2019s biggest bank, JP Morgan, said that the so-called \u201cTrump trade\u201d could last another eight weeks.\u00a0 This, the analysts argued, is not only down to Trump wanting to support the tech industry but also step up his tariff policy. Tariffs, taxes on imported goods, are likely to lead to an increase in inflation, economists have argued. And Bitcoin has long been touted as an inflation hedge.\u00a0 Analysts at Bernstein said in another report this month that Trump trade or not, the asset dubbed \u201cdigital gold\u201d would still hit $200,000 by the end of next year.\u00a0 Bulls all around Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. \u00a9 A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc."},{"source":"ABC News","author":"JOE REEDY AP sports writer","title":"Tyson-Paul bout gives Netflix opportunity to show it can handle big events","description":"Jake Paul and Mike Tyson aren\u2019t the only ones who have high stakes when they meet in the boxing ring on Friday night","url":"https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Entertainment\/wireStory\/tyson-paul-bout-netflix-opportunity-show-handle-big-115890280","published_at":"2024-11-15T11:58:45Z","content":"This page either does not exist or is currently unavailable.

The performance was impacted by soft-demand conditions, material price inflation, and performances of the decorative and coatings business. HDFC Securities had earlier mentioned that the paints sector is likely to grapple with elevated capacity levels and rising competitive intensity (Grasim\u2019s entry into paints) in the near-to-medium term. Many brokerages have slashed the target prices, downgrading the stock.  Global brokerage JP Morgan downgraded Asian Paints to underweight at a reduced target price of \u20b92,400 from \u20b92,800 earlier. Morgan Stanley has also given underweight rating at a target price of \u20b92,522. CLSA and Jefferies have assigned underperform rating on the stock at the target price of \u20b92,290 and \u20b92,100, respectively.

Maintaining \u2018reduce\u2019 rating on Asian Paints at a target price of \u20b92,425 from \u20b92,550, they added that the comp[any could post y-o-y earnings decline in FY25 after a gap of almost 17 years.  \u201cWe reckon comfortable competitive equilibrium in paints is likely broken.

The Orchard residential skyscraper by Perkins Eastman is situated on the edge of the Long Island City district of Queens, an area near the East River that has experienced a boom in residential skyscraper construction over the last decade. It recently topped out at over 823 feet (250 metres), making it the tallest skyscraper in the borough, unseating the Hill West Architects-designed Skyline Tower, which has a height of 762 feet (232 metres). Next to a massive train depot, among a cluster of recently built skyscrapers, the structure consists of a massive podium covered partially by the tower portion. The rest of the podium is only a few storeys tall, dedicated to parking and will feature a large green space. The website for the building, run by developers BLDG Management Company and Corcoran New Development, says the 60,000-square-foot (5,574 square metres) green space will be \"New York's biggest backyard\". According to renderings, its skyscraper portion will be a largely symmetrical tower with two distinct vertical aspects distinguished by slight differentiation in the colouration of the curtain wall \u2013 which characterises most of the facade \u2013 and the floorplates. The thinner of the two vertical elements will have two steps near the top to make room for rooftop amenity spaces. Its crown will span the wider of the vertical elements and have large, lit panels that will create a geometric effect. The developers have announced that the residential portion will be complemented by a bounteous array of amenities including three pickleball courts, an orchard grove, and a dog park. The topmost floor will be dedicated to a sky lounge. BLDG Management president Lloyd Goldman said that the skyscraper will set \"a new standard for luxury residences\" in Queens. \"Now officially the tallest tower in the borough, the Orchard is designed to offer residents an unparalleled living experience,\" he said. \"As we move closer to completion of the premier rental address in Queens, The Orchard reflects our commitment to creating a home that is not only sophisticated by also deeply connected to the vibrant energy of Long Island City.\" Queens is the second most populated borough in New York City, and if it were its own city, it would be the fourth most populated in the United States. Last year, SHoP Architects completed the tallest skyscraper in neighbouring Brooklyn, the 1,066-foot-tall (325 metre) Brooklyn Tower. In Manhattan, Foster + Partners' all-electric supertall skyscraper for JP Morgan is nearing completion. The images are by Binyan.

High interest rates, he reported, had slammed the brakes on art lending, the growing business of banks and specialist firms lending against high-net-worth collectors\u2019 art. \n\tThe macroeconomic theory appeared sound. In the 2010s and the Covid era, interest rates were at their lowest level in decades and the value of artworks had risen steadily. Borrowing money had never been cheaper. But by this year, with interest rates on the incline over the last three years and the art market seemingly ground to a halt, one theory was that the loan business would slow as well.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRelated Articles\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCollector Libbie Mugrabi Embroiled in Legal Battle with Art-Backed Lending Company\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecession or Not, Finance Sector's Ties with the Art World Are Getting Tighter\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\tBut conversations with half a dozen specialist art lenders, as well as those at major banks, paint a far different picture of the art lending sector, one in which business is booming, in no small part because of the larger stalling of the art market. \n\tAmong the big bank lenders, the largest, by far, is Bank of America. While a source speculated to Maneker that the bank\u2019s $10 billion loan book had dropped to $8 billion over the last 18 months, Drew Watson, the head of art services at the bank, said the bank\u2019s book was actually up 10 percent this year. \n\tThat growth, Watson told ARTnews, is tied to a long-term trend possibly more vital to the art world than interest rates: collectors are increasingly incorporating their art holdings into their \u201coverall wealth strategy.\u201d \n\t\u201cThere\u2019s also a generational shift happening now. Younger people are being more opportunistic about their collections and other tangible assets,\u201d he said, pointing to the annual Art & Finance report by Deloitte and ArtTactic. Published last year, it estimated that the art lending business was up 11 percent from 2022, reaching a total value of between $29.2 billion and $34.1 billion. \n\tWatson added that the less than \u201crobust\u201d current market is another factor pushing collectors toward loans. \u201cBorrowing when the market is down is an alternative that some collectors pursue to avoid selling into a down market,\u201d he said.\n\n \n\tThe other two major institutional players are Citibank and J.P. Morgan. While J.P. Morgan declined to comment on its art loan business, Citibank\u2019s head of art finance, Fotini Xydas, told ARTnews that its portfolio over the last decade has nearly doubled, the size of the art loans growing as well. \n\t\u201cWhile our largest market continues to be North America, with approximately 70 percent of our art loan portfolio overall, we have seen particularly strong growth in EMEA [Europe, Middle East, and Africa] and APAC [Asia-Pacific], with average annual growth rates of 18 percent and over 100 percent, respectively, over the past seven to eight years,\u201d Xydas said. \n\tBut, as Watson put it, the art lending business is actually two very different businesses. On the one side are the big banks like Bank of America, which can offer interest rates at or close to prime, because they lend against a diverse portfolio. On the other are specialist lenders, who lend only against art. The latter, he said, have to offer interest rates much higher than the big banks. \n\tThis begs the question: If the art lending arms of big banks are trumping industry estimates as collectors seek liquidity without selling their works in a slow art market, are the specialty art lenders also riding this wave? \n\tThe London-based Fine Art Group has been offering loans solely against artworks for more than 20 years; according to CEO Philip Hoffman, it currently has a loan book close to $200 million, with an upper limit of $800 million. But he conceded that current interest rates\u2014and his firm\u2019s need to make a margin of 4 to 6 percent over that\u2014means that lending \u201cisn\u2019t cheap at the moment.\u201d \n\t\u201cIf you think art prices are going to go up by 20 to 50 percent over the next three or four years, from a low right now, borrowing against your art does make sense if you don\u2019t want to sell it and you need some financing,\u201d Hoffman told ARTnews. \u201cOn the horizon, interest rates probably come down a percent or two over the next year and a half. I think a lot of people are underleveraged on art or have no leverage.\u201d \n\tAdam Chinn, the former COO of Sotheby\u2019s and now a managing partner at specialist art lender International Art Finance (IAF), told ARTnews that since IAF was launched in 2023, the business has put out $180 million in loans with \u201csignificant demand\u201d for more. By the end of the year, he said he expects IAF\u2019s book to be nearer $200 million. \n\t\u201cObviously, interest rates are high compared to where they were four years ago, but the art business is\u2014and always has been\u2014significantly undercapitalized,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s huge opportunity for art lenders at the moment. A lot of our business is with the dealer\/gallery community and they don\u2019t really have access to capital. Historically, the way dealers have raised money is, they\u2019ve gone to someone who has put up the money\u2014but they\u2019ve given up 50 percent of their profit to the funder.\u201d \n\tThe other major players in the art lending business are those run by the auction houses\u2014Christie\u2019s Art Finance and Sotheby\u2019s Financial Services (SFS). SFS\u2019s global head of lending, Scott Milleisen, told ARTnews that its loan book has doubled from $800 million to $1.6 billion since 2021. (Credit rating agency Morningstar DBRS confirmed the latter figure.) While Christie\u2019s declined to comment about its business, it has publicly said it offers art-backed loans starting at $1 million. An employee at a major art lender familiar with Christie\u2019s Art Finance said its business is doing \u201cvery well\u201d and estimated its loan book to be \u201cabout $500 million.\u201d However, one art financier told\u00a0ARTnews\u00a0that Christie\u2019s scaled back on its art lending in 2008 \u201cbecause the market imploded,\u201d and now uses lending as a means to secure consignments for auction. \n\tHoffman claimed that his firm, as well as Christie\u2019s Art Finance and SFS, are all currently lending at about 10 percent of their potential\u2014and of where they should be in five to eight years\u2019 time. While Milleisen dodged that question, he did say he believes SFS can double the size of its loan book again over the next few years, particularly with interest rates expected to drop further. He added that he thinks the art lending business will heat up even more when the art market picks up and prices start to rise again. \n\t\u201cYou need to consider the context of the overall market\u2014Deloitte estimates the lending market to be worth around $30 billion, so I measure success by taking share of this figure,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are creating a new paradigm at SFS by offering large loans of $100 million or more backed solely by the value of art. That has never been done before. To go from $1.5 billion to $3 billion is totally achievable.\u201d \n\tIn April SFS began offering securities backed by art and collectibles-secured loans for the first time. The $700 million offering has brought the total funding capacity of SFS to $2 billion. \n\tStill, despite the positive buzz around the art lending business, not everyone is buying the swollen loan book narrative. \n\tJan Prasens, the former managing director of SFS and principal of JP Art & Finance Advisory, which matches art collectors with financing partners, told ARTnews that specialty art lenders aren\u2019t always willing to disclose the true size of their loan books. He cautioned that some lenders are putting their own capital at risk, while others are merely acting like agents for outside investors. \n\tMeghan Carleton, a managing partner at US-based, privately owned specialty art lender AOI Advisors, also said loan book figures should be taken with a big pinch of salt. Alessandro Fiorotto, Christie\u2019s former regional managing director of art finance for EMEA and managing director of AF Advisory, told ARTnews that he\u2019s skeptical of claims that the specialty art lending business is thriving. He said the market has become \u201cincreasingly saturated with lenders.\u201d \n\t\u201cIf you want a $30 million or $50 million loan, collectors are smart enough to shop around\u2014they\u2019ll go to Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s and find out who is offering the best rate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is that the auction houses can lend at a much cheaper rate than [specialty lenders], so they\u2019re rarely going to get those types of big deals. They can\u2019t offer the kind of sweeteners that the auction houses can offer, and they can\u2019t lend at the same rate. They win very few [of these deals]. Independent lenders often like to talk about the value of being independent from the auction houses, but in reality any significant collector in the art world has bought or sold a piece through Christie\u2019s or Sotheby\u2019s, so they already have a relationship with them and they\u2019re going to transact with them in the future.\u201d \n\tAs a result, Fiorotto said independent specialist art lenders are left competing for the loans Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s don\u2019t want, which he said are often \u201cdistressed,\u201d \u201csmall,\u201d or \u201ccarry higher risk.\u201d \u201cWhile they\u2019re still able to provide loans, I think we\u2019ll start to see a consolidation in the market,\u201d he added. \n\tWhile Prasens agreed that the market is likely saturated, he said specialty lenders are often the preferred lender for collectors, as many like to keep sale and purchase transactions separate and free of the exclusivity restrictions that an auction house might require in a contract. \n\t\u201cOthers like to look at it more holistically and may not mind certain restrictions if it fits their ultimate exit strategy for the collateral,\u201d Prasens said. \u201cAuction houses are uniquely positioned to put in place incentive structures that may reduce the ultimate cost of the loan for the client. This is not so different from how private banks are able to provide low-cost financing on the back of other services they engage their clients with.\u201d \n\tAs for Athena Art Finance, while its parent company, Yieldstreet, recently went through a round of layoffs, Athena CEO Rebecca Fine told ARTnews that Athena is \u201cthriving\u201d and has seen 45 percent growth so far in 2024. She said Athena has originated more than $850 million in art loans. \n\tFine added that Athena\u2019s main competition is not specialty art lenders but the auction houses and, increasingly, private banks that are pulling back from noncore lending operations. \n\t\u201cAthena\u2019s independence is a big competitive advantage because our clients have zero pressure to consign or sell, and when and if they do decide to sell, they can put the auction houses and galleries in competition to achieve the best terms,\u201d she said. \n\tStephan Ludwig, co-CEO of advisory firm Gurr Johns, told ARTnews that he thinks the specialty art lending business is far from saturated and that the market has adjusted to higher interest rates. \n\t\u201cA lot of our borrowers are borrowing the money to leverage their assets to reinvest in higher yielding assets,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at a private equity investment that\u2019s going to return 25 percent, paying at 11 percent for the loan, you\u2019ve still got a good margin on that. It\u2019s a very sexy part of the market.\u201d \n\tWith art fair season in full swing and the all-important November auctions fast approaching, art lenders will only receive more inquiries, according to Naomi Baigell, the former managing director of Australian specialty art lender TPC Finance. \n\t\u201cPeople are starting to figure out how to best manage their portfolios\u2014art lending comes into that conversation,\u201d she told ARTnews. \u201cMany collectors take a loan from a specialty art lender rather than an auction house, which might want to capture the collateral artwork for a future consignment, or a bank that typically takes a long time to facilitate a loan. If you know you have capital in your back pocket and you know you\u2019re going to negotiate with a gallery at an art fair, for example, you can do that quite effectively if you can give them cash in hand, and if you have the resources to buy X, Y, and Z.

While the IPO received a moderate subscription of 3.2 times, the listing performance is considered positive given the company\u2019s specific focus on the U.S. healthcare market, which is subject to various regulatory and economic factors. However, investors should remain cautious. The company\u2019s reliance on a single market and the potential impact of U.S. policy changes could pose risks. Additionally, the high valuation and the nature of the IPO as a complete offer for sale (OFS) may limit upside potential. Investors who participated in the IPO may consider holding their shares by keeping a stoploss around 28, but closely monitoring the company\u2019s performance and market dynamics is crucial.

Two asset classes were the main culprits, with approximately $831.1 million in office loans and $515 million in retail loans accounting for nearly 70 percent of these new delinquencies, according to Moody\u2019s.\u00a0 Darrell Wheeler, head of CMBS research at Moody\u2019s Ratings, told CO that office loan refinancing rates of 41.5 percent remain well below the overall CMBS refinance rates of 58.7 percent.\u00a0 \u201cThee third quarter of 2023 is when the delinquency rate started to go up,\u201d he said. \u201cSo as [these loans] were coming due in the third quarter, which is the first time the 10-year Treasury hit 5 percent, we saw a lot of borrowers not refinance in that same time period.\u201d\u00a0 Wheeler added that office sponsors have \u201ca limited supply of potential finance options,\u201d due to the increased interest rates and lower property values. Moody\u2019s Ratings found that average U.S. CRE prices have fallen 10.7 percent since mid-2022, with average office and multifamily prices declining by 23 percent and 19 percent, respectively.\u00a0 \u201cWe expect that office, as more leases roll over, will have less NOI to show and it will be more challenging for some time to come for the office buildings to refinance,\u201d said Wheeler.\u00a0\u00a0 Due to the typical 10-year lease term on most office deals, CMBS loans originated in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 have delinquency rates of 56.4 percent, 62.47 percent, 55.29 percent, and 60.17 percent, respectively, per Moody\u2019s Ratings data. By comparison, CMBS office loans originated in 2016 and 2017 have delinquency rates less than 5 percent.\u00a0\u00a0 Among the largest CMBS maturity defaults that have occurred in the last month are a $200 million loan secured by The Prince Building, a 12-story, mixed-use complex at 568 Broadway in New York City \u2014 COMM 2012-CR3, COMM 2012-CR4; a $200 million loan secured by 500 Fifth Avenue, a 60-story office tower in New York City \u2014 CSAIL 2015-C1, JPMBB 2014-C26; and a $99.5 loan secured by CityPlace, a 40 acre office complex in St. Louis \u2014 JPMBB 2014-C25.\u00a0 Wheeler said that hybrid-work is the main contributor to office defaults, as his research estimated that widespread hybrid work patterns have lowered office demand between 14 percent and 22 percent.\u00a0 \u201cThe office market hasn\u2019t been performing with employment gains,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cAbout 7.3 million jobs have been created since 2019, and the office market has just not responded to that, or at least how it traditionally would have, because of hybrid work.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cAs these leases roll over from existing tenants, we\u2019re seeing sponsors take 22 percent less potential revenue at lower leasing rates,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s lagging, and these maturities will continue to happen for the next three or four years.\u201d Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!"},{"source":"The Times of India","author":"Times Of India","title":"Ahead of Swiggy IPO listing Sensex opens with over 170 points drop, Nifty at 23,800","description":"Sensex Today, Swiggy Price & IPO Listing Live: Swiggy's IPO is set to be listed on stock exchanges today.

Stock Market Today: Markets decline in initial trade amid soaring inflation, foreign fund exodus Equity benchmark indices declined in early trade, with the BSE Sensex falling by 239.69 points to 78,435.49 and the NSE Nifty dropping by 103.15 points to 23,780.30. This decline was driven by rising retail inflation, which surged to a 14-month high of 6.21% in October, fueled by increasing food prices. Additionally, continued foreign fund outflows, muted quarterly earnings, and weak global market trends contributed to the market downturn. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) sold equities worth Rs 3,024.31 crore. Asian markets, including Seoul, Tokyo, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, were also trading lower, while US markets ended in negative territory.

Swiggy IPO Listing Live: Employees allowed to sell Swiggy shares a month after IPO An exemption on the mandatory one-year lock-in period, secured by Swiggy from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in July this year meant that employees are allowed to sell shares a month after the IPO. According to Swiggy\u2019s prospectus, the company has rolled out three Esop plans so far\u2014one each in 2015, 2021 and 2024. This aggregates to a pool of almost 230 million shares. Of these, 9 million options have been exercised into shares, while the remaining are yet to be exercised. What Swiggy can learn from Zomato\u2019s epic stock meltdown The market reception for the e-commerce giant's initial public offering is likely to be subdued compared to the enthusiastic welcome received by its competitor Zomato during its 2021 listing. Nevertheless, Swiggy can derive valuable insights from Zomato's journey, which saw a significant share price decline followed by a remarkable recovery. To achieve valuation parity with Zomato, Swiggy would benefit from establishing and adhering to specific profitability goals with defined timelines.While investors appreciate compelling business narratives, Swiggy needs to recognise that in the current market environment, shareholders are increasingly prone to divest their holdings if financial performance falls short of projected targets.

The performance was impacted by soft-demand conditions, material price inflation, and performances of the decorative and coatings business. HDFC Securities had earlier mentioned that the paints sector is likely to grapple with elevated capacity levels and rising competitive intensity (Grasim\u2019s entry into paints) in the near-to-medium term. Many brokerages have slashed the target prices, downgrading the stock.  Global brokerage JP Morgan downgraded Asian Paints to underweight at a reduced target price of \u20b92,400 from \u20b92,800 earlier. Morgan Stanley has also given underweight rating at a target price of \u20b92,522. CLSA and Jefferies have assigned underperform rating on the stock at the target price of \u20b92,290 and \u20b92,100, respectively.

For Netflix, it is their biggest live sports event to date, and an opportunity to make sure it can handle audience demand with the NFL and WWE on the horizon. The bout between the YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul, and Tyson, 58-year-old former heavyweight champion, from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, will stream globally and be available to Netflix's 280 million subscribers at no additional cost. Netflix will broadcast the bout in English, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, French and German. It was originally scheduled for July 20, but was delayed by Tyson having a medical episode on a plane and needing time to recover from a stomach ulcer. Netflix declined multiple requests by The Associated Press to make a company executive available to discuss expectations about the fight. JP Morgan Chase analyst Doug Anmuth has not wavered in his prediction that it will be the most-watched fight ever. That might be an unrealistic bar to climb since four of Muhammad Ali's bouts had estimated worldwide audiences of one billion. The modern-day U.S. mark of 4.6 million from the 2015 bout between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao could be attainable though. \"We believe the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight could be the most watched boxing match ever given ease of access and NFLX's (Netflix's) large global subscriber base, and it should attract Ad Tier subs, viewers, and dollars,\" Anmuth said in his analyst note according to CNBC Pro. \"Netflix is increasingly focused on sports entertainment, events, and shoulder content, and we expect a bigger push into live sports over time, particularly as negotiating leverage shifts in NFLX's direction.\" Netflix has used live sports as support programming for documentaries and series it airs. \"Countdown: Paul vs. Tyson\", a three-part documentary series previewing the fight card, was ranked second Thursday night among Netflix's most-viewed shows. Last November's Netflix Cup, where Formula 1 drivers were paired with PGA golfers in a match-play format, brought together famous figures from \"Drive to Survive\" and \"Full Swing,\" The March 3 Netflix Slam exhibition match between Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz tied in with \"Point Break\" and a documentary series about Alcaraz that will air next year. The NFL elected to partner with Netflix for a Christmas Day doubleheader of games because two series - \"Quarterback\" and \"Receiver\" - were among Netflix's top 10 series globally. Most Valuable Promotions is handling the production of Friday's bout while CBS will produce the two NFL games for Netflix. When \"Raw\" begins airing on Netflix on Jan. 5, World Wrestling Entertainment handles the production of all its events. Netflix will carry \"Raw\" in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Latin America beginning in January, with additional countries to be added as contracts expire. The bigger component, though, is that Netflix becomes the carrier of all WWE shows and specials outside the U.S. and the company's premium live events, including WrestleMania and SummerSlam. \"Technically, it is a great dry run by putting on live events. The biggest problem they might have is you just end up in a situation where you've got so much volume and viewing a way that you haven't had in the past,\" said Patrick Crakes, a media consultant and former Fox Sports executive. \"It could end up being more than who watches the NFL games for a period of time. Others are handling the production, what they have to worry about is the operational flow. They know what they are doing.\" \u00a9  Unidad Editorial Informaci\u00f3n Deportiva, S.L.U.

So the office market has been challenging, but there\u2019s a lot to be optimistic and excited about.\u201d This sense of optimism amid challenges permeated the event. After brief opening remarks by Observer Media CEO James Freiman and Alexander Durst, a Durst Organization principal and its chief development officer, Brown and Mechanic discussed how occupier diversity is starting to resemble the pre-COVID office market. \u201cFor the past couple years in New York, activity feels like it\u2019s been led by financial services, law firms, large accounting consultancy firms,\u201d said Brown, \u201cand we\u2019ve seen the vacuum of activity be sucked out from tech occupiers.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cThey were so hot to trot for a long time,\u201d said Mechanic of tech tenants. \u201cThey were dominating the market, and now they\u2019re not to be seen.\u201d Brown noted that this is due to more rational behavior on the part of tech occupiers regarding how much space they need. \u201cThey all took a lot of space, so when that goes back, we got the benefit of that,\u201d said Brown. \u201cBut now it has become so much more diverse than it historically has been. We\u2019ve had a concentration of a certain sector leading the market, but I think you\u2019ll see a much wider diversity of occupier coming back to New York.\u201d During an office outlook panel that provided a deeper dive on the office market, Steven Rotter, executive vice chairman at Newmark, noted that whatever vacancy rates indicate overall, theories on flight to quality have held up. That\u2019s because the need to attract and keep top employees makes space in the best buildings as important and hard to find as ever. \u201cAmenities are always one of two things tenants are asking for. The biggest thing that\u2019s changed is location,\u201d said Rotter. \u201cFor people wanting to be near Penn Station or Grand Central, in new developments, it\u2019s very hard to find space in those buildings. There\u2019s under 5 percent vacancy no matter what the news says. Work-from-home discussions are over. People are back at the office. We\u2019re seeing bidding wars for the first time since 2019.\u201d\u00a0 Thomas Bow, executive vice president of commercial leasing at The Durst Organization, Jonathan Kaufman Iger, CEO and president of Sage Realty, and moderator Andrew Charles, a partner at Kramer Levin, were also on the panel. Next came a discussion on the effects of flight to quality on New York\u2019s office market.\u00a0 While top-shelf amenities are top of mind in the office realm, Christina Chiu, president of Empire State Realty Trust, noted that flight-to-quality expectations are no longer coming solely from Class A tenants. \u201cTenants want the best quality they can get at any price point,\u201d said Chiu. \u201cThat includes physicality, floor plan, ceiling height, amenities, programming \u2014 all of that is really important. They want the best, and they expect the building to be energy efficient and on top of their team.\u201d Chiu noted that this expectation actively extends to the financial health of the building\u2019s owner, which needs to be Class A even if the building is not.\u00a0 \u201cIt used to be the case that we\u2019d say, \u2018We have a good balance sheet, come lease with us.\u2019 The reality is I don\u2019t know if it really matters,\u201d said Chiu. \u201cNow you have buildings at risk of going into special servicing. We don\u2019t know what will happen. So financial stability is right up there on the list.\u201d Also on this panel were Ashlea Aaron, senior managing director of commercial leasing for Durst; Craig Deitelzweig, president and CEO of Marx Realty; Callie Haines, executive vice president and Northeast head at Brookfield Properties; and moderator Nina Roket, co-managing partner at Olshan Frome Wolosky.\u00a0 Next up came two keynote Interviews. First, Fried Frank partner Jennifer Yashar interviewed Mary Ann Tighe, CEO of CBRE\u2019s New York tri-state region.\u00a0 Tighe said that as high-end amenity packages have become the be-all and end-all for so many tenants, a building\u2019s amenities have become its brand. \u201cI\u2019ve had this interesting experience that when I go on a tour with a customer and come back and talk about the building, they don\u2019t refer to it by the address,\u201d said Tighe. \u201cThey say, \u2018The building that had that great roof deck,\u2019 or whatever. And I realized that amenities have become the branding of the building. This is not particular to New York. My colleagues around the United States, around North America, are observing this as well.\u201d Next, Commercial Observer Editor-in-Chief Max Gross interviewed Bruce Mosler, Cushman & Wakefield\u2019s chairman of global brokerage, who confirmed the event\u2019s optimism regarding the state of office leasing.\u00a0 \u201cThe better-quality space \u2014 new development, Class A, redevelopment space \u2014 has begun to shrink in occupancy, and that signaled to tenants, I believe, the belief that if we don\u2019t move now, we\u2019re not gonna get the space we want,\u201d said Mosler. \u201cBetter-quality space is moving. Space that buildings have been reinvesting in is moving.\u201d\u00a0 Due to this, companies are starting renewal negotiations far earlier than they might have otherwise.\u00a0 \u201cThe financial services market is savvy. The tech market is savvy. The services sector is savvy,\u201d Mosler said. \u201cAnd all of them looked back and said, \u2018Where we want to be may not be available unless we enter the market today, five years ahead of our lease negotiations.\u2019\u201d Next, for a panel on residential conversions, Commercial Observer\u2019s Gross, who moderated, asked New York City Department of City Planning Director Dan Garodnick to share some of the weirdest provisions he\u2019s seen within the city\u2019s zoning codes. \u201cWhen we were looking at our last proposal on economic opportunity, a lot of rules were laughably outdated,\u201d said Garodnick. \u201cWe saw protections, incentives or provisions for typewriter repair shops, model car hobby shops and airline ticketing offices, with a definition for their use and where they can be located in New York City.\u201d But, while these outdated provisions stuck out, the zoning was just as notable for what it was missing.\u00a0 \u201cThere was no provision for, let\u2019s say, allowing high-tech manufacturing to exist in a commercial office building,\u201d said Garodnick. \u201cThat really stuck with me because it showed that these rules were written in the 1950s or `60s, and had not been updated.\u201d Also on the panel were Basha Gerhards, senior vice president of planning for the Real Estate Board of New York (REBNY), and Doug Hayden, founder and president at prefabricated construction firm Arthroto. Next up, for a tighter focus on workplace amenities, Alyssa Zahler, managing director of leasing at Two Trees Management, noted that one amenity growing in preference for occupiers was an enhancement of social opportunities. \u201cMore important than the amenity you\u2019re building is finding ways to help tenants connect,\u201d said Zahler. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that people feel lonely. People miss interacting with other companies and finding ways to create business, create relationships.\u201d By way of example, Zahler mentioned that Two Tress was holding a mixer that evening for the company\u2019s tenants in Brooklyn\u2019s Dumbo neighborhood. \u201cWe reached out to all of our tenants in the creative industry,\u201d said Zahler. \u201cCreating opportunities like that is a really important touch point, in addition to how gorgeous is your amenity space. We\u2019re seeing that as landlords \u2014 we are becoming a bit like a social committee for our tenants. That\u2019s something really important to touch on.\u201d\u00a0 The panel was rounded out by Jim Somoza, managing director and partner at Brooklyn\u2019s Industry City; Andrew Wiener, head of commercial leasing at The Feil Organization; and moderator William Lang, a partner at Winston & Strawn. The final panel of the day took on how technology, sustainability and economic factors are influencing future office plans.\u00a0\u00a0 Mike Daschle, senior vice president of sustainability for Brookfield Properties, noted that a focus on sustainability for an owner\u2019s properties becomes asset-enhancing on all fronts. \u201cWe look at sustainability as a value-creation tool,\u201d said Daschle. \u201cThis is something where we can align values with our most important customers in a way that adds value to the buildings and also mitigates risk. If you want access to the type of capital that\u2019s going to invest in the types of funds that can reposition properties like [Brookfield\u2019s] 660 Fifth Avenue, that type of money comes with certain sustainability requirements.\u201d Also on the panel were Calli Stavola, director of development at owner Savanna; Zach Steinberg, senior vice president of policy for REBNY, and moderator Stephen Rizzo, CEO of CodeGreen Solutions.

However, how to assess and cultivate the specific virtues required for interdisciplinarity among researchers is still a matter of inquiry. The general objective of this paper was to develop a psychometric instrument to assess intellectual virtues that are essential for interdisciplinary inquiry among researchers. To achieve this goal, two studies were conducted. Study 1 developed a new scale and studied its correlation with other validated measures. Study 2 focused on conducting a confirmatory analysis of the structure obtained in Study 1 and investigated the relationships between the new scale and the researchers\u2019 levels of (i) experience and productivity in interdisciplinary collaboration and (ii) satisfaction regarding the results of their interdisciplinary inquiry. The EFA conducted for Study 1 identified four dimensions: (1) intellectual empathy, (2) open-mindedness and intellectual humility, (3) intellectual perseverance, and (4) curiosity. Indeed, the pools of items that were initially developed to measure intellectual humility and open-mindedness in a separate way converged into a unique factor or dimension. The confirmatory factor analysis conducted for Study 2 corroborated the four-dimensional structure observed in Study 1 via a new different sample. In addition, Studies 1 and 2 also analyzed convergent validity through the AVE and correlated the IVIRS with other scales that measure intellectual virtues (open-mindedness, curiosity, intellectual humility, and perseverance) in a general epistemic context. The second study demonstrated that researchers with significant experience, productivity, and satisfaction in the context of interdisciplinary investigation also presented elevated levels of the intellectual virtues that we identified as essential for such research. Our analysis demonstrates that the IVIRS is a valid measure of the intellectual virtues needed for interdisciplinarity and paves the way for the future design of interventions to cultivate these character traits in scholars.

In many academic areas, interdisciplinary research has become a desired goal. It is a practice that produces new knowledge by integrating insights from different fields. It involves establishing connections between various branches of knowledge, fostering the emergence of new ideas, gaining enrichment from diverse perspectives, and promoting greater collegiality and academic collaboration. However, many challenges are associated with interdisciplinarity [1] because this kind of approach requires complex social and intellectual processes as a team-based type of research [2\u20134]. Indeed, social coordination among researchers of different disciplines can be difficult due to the varying levels of expertise and understanding of each other\u2019s work [5]. In addition, there is a need to possess sufficient knowledge in several domains to be able to collaborate with experts from other fields, which implies considerable time commitment. Moreover, some researchers have noted that interdisciplinary research is more likely to be superficial [6]. In short, interdisciplinary success requires diligent translation, a shared understanding, and respect for the slow growth of specialized knowledge [7], all of which are challenging requirements. Although empirical studies on interdisciplinary cognition at the individual level have largely been neglected in the literature [8], recent investigations have suggested that cultivating specific epistemic virtues among researchers can help overcome the barriers to interdisciplinary success [9]. Like any other researcher, an interdisciplinary scholar must possess a wide range of intellectual skills and capabilities. However, because interdisciplinarity involves extending the use of intellectual character strengths beyond one\u2019s own field and reflecting deeply on areas other than one\u2019s own, deploying epistemic virtues within the framework of interdisciplinary work is also more demanding. Additionally, interdisciplinary researchers must cultivate specific dispositions that enable them to think collaboratively. In this context, the area of philosophy known as virtue epistemology presents a promising strategy for studying the dispositions of researchers and addressing the problems we have mentioned. Since the pioneering works of Ernest Sosa and Linda Zagzebski [10, 11], virtue epistemology has been developed as a novel approach for solving certain challenges within the philosophy of knowledge [12, 13]. The common thesis of these authors was to shift the focus of epistemology from the evaluation of properties of beliefs to the evaluation of certain properties or dispositions of persons [14]. Hence, the distinctive feature of the approach proposed by virtue epistemology lies in emphasizing the consideration of cognitive faculties and the virtues that perfect them to account for the possibility of attaining knowledge of truth [15]. However, virtue epistemology is a research program that includes a diverse collection of approaches to epistemology [13]. Some virtue epistemologists consider intellectual virtues as the proper character traits for excellent thinkers [11]. Examples of these virtues are curiosity, intellectual humility, open-mindedness, and intellectual perseverance, among those that have received the most attention. In both philosophy and psychology, numerous studies have focused on applying intellectual virtues to different fields, such as education [16] and scientific research [17]. Another focus of interest has been the relationship between virtue epistemology and the philosophy of science [18]. Given that in this context, intellectual virtues are defined as personal qualities that support the pursuit of knowledge across domains, it would be logical to assume that they may, in turn, contribute to overcoming obstacles to interdisciplinary research [18]. Following rigorously the consensual qualitative analysis, a methodology that suggests a sample size of 8\u201315 participants [19], Vanney et al. [20] analyzed nine interviews involving researchers with a long personal trajectory of interdisciplinary research in the sciences and the humanities to identify intellectual virtues relevant to interdisciplinary research. Three domains were identified in this research: intellectual virtues, social virtues, and interpersonal intellectual virtues. In addition, six categories of intellectual virtues were highlighted: intellectual humility, open-mindedness, intellectual perseverance, curiosity, intellectual honesty, and intellectual autonomy. Five categories within the domain of social virtues were emphasized: friendship, kindness, collaborative spirit, sense of humor, and communication skills. Finally, four categories within the domain of interpersonal intellectual virtues were identified: intellectual empathy, intellectual respect, intellectual trust, and intellectual generosity. Additionally, the authors ranked the frequency of the categories in terms of the number of respondents who mentioned them. Only four virtues were mentioned by all the scholars: intellectual humility, open-mindedness, intellectual perseverance, and intellectual empathy. Thus, according to this study, these virtues represent interdisciplinary researchers\u2019 most salient character traits. On the basis of these findings, this paper hypothesizes that an interdisciplinary researcher needs several virtues to conduct interdisciplinary research successfully. As a starting point, we propose a multidimensional instrument that includes the four critical virtues for interdisciplinary work previously mentioned while also incorporating curiosity. Although curiosity was not universally mentioned in the study just discussed, seven of the nine interviewees highlighted that it is an intrinsic motivator for any epistemic endeavor. Researchers\u2019 focus on intellectual humility has increased over the past decade, resulting in numerous works on this topic [21, 22]. Among its various conceptualizations, recognizing one\u2019s own intellectual limitations [23\u201326] and, more comprehensively, embracing one\u2019s own intellectual strengths and weaknesses [27] stand out. When performing scholarly work in a group context, as in the case of interdisciplinary research, intellectual humility also implies an awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of one\u2019s own field. In this sense, this virtue can be embodied when one recognizes that other disciplines always have something new to teach us and when one is willing to admit that one\u2019s opinions are limited in the context of interdisciplinary discussions. Intellectual humility is often characterized by an individual\u2019s readiness to correct and learn from his or her mistakes. Open-minded individuals are willing to consider the merits of alternative viewpoints, even if those viewpoints differ from their own, because they believe that doing so can help them discover the truth [28\u201330]. People can transcend their biases and become more receptive to new ideas and knowledge by being open-minded. Open-mindedness can be viewed as the willingness to learn new things, consider different theoretical alternatives, and accept other views concerning an issue if they are well founded [31]. Interdisciplinary research evidently requires open-mindedness, which involves actively listening to and considering perspectives drawn from other disciplines. This quality also entails being willing to change one\u2019s opinion when presented with well-founded arguments by colleagues from other fields. In interdisciplinary work, this virtue is also embodied when the individual desires to approach research topics from multiple disciplinary perspectives. Virtue epistemologists usually emphasize that epistemic goals are challenging and require continuous effort over time. Intellectual perseverance is necessary to persist in one\u2019s intellectual endeavors despite obstacles [32, 33]. Angela Duckworth made significant contributions to our understanding of this notion in psychology by studying grit and developing a scale to measure this factor [34\u201336]. As intellectual perseverance is essential for success in any academic endeavor, it is crucial in interdisciplinary research because it enables team members to overcome the difficulties associated with interdisciplinarity, thus helping them maintain their intellectual efforts over time. This intellectual virtue encourages the individual to investigate and inquire about topics that exceed his or her understanding without accepting simplistic or facile solutions [37]. As an epistemic virtuous quality, curiosity involves being appropriately discerning (by being aimed at the correct subject), timely (by emerging in the appropriate circumstances), and exacting (by avoiding becoming contented too easily) [38]. Curiosity is an intrinsic motivator that sparks and sustains the learning process [16]. Furthermore, curiosity plays a vital role in successful epistemic collaboration [39]. In interdisciplinary research, this virtue is characterized by a strong desire to learn and achieve a more comprehensive and profound understanding with the help of disciplines other than one\u2019s own. A recent paper identified a subgroup of intellectual virtues known as interpersonal intellectual virtues [40]. These virtues are \u201cdefined as personal character traits that facilitate the reciprocal acquisition and distribution of knowledge with and through other people\u201d (p. 173). They aim for the epistemic good like all intellectual virtues, but they apply interpersonally, like social virtues. Intellectual empathy is a paradigmatic example of an interpersonal intellectual virtue. This virtue entails two ways of understanding another person\u2019s thinking: (i) seeing things from their point of view and (ii) feeling moved to follow the other person\u2019s cognitive process. In interdisciplinary research, intellectual empathy helps us understand how scholars from different disciplines approach a common problem with the aim of imitating that approach to complement their own methodology. Assessments of intellectual virtues are still in an incipient stage of development, with a few exceptions, such as intellectual humility. In fact, many scales have been proposed to measure intellectual humility, such as those advanced by Alfano [41], Leary et al. [42], and Krumrei-Mancuso [43], among others. Despite different scales being based on diverse categorizations of intellectual humility, they all generally consider intellectual humility to be a stable attribute of a person or personality [44]. An instrument that deserves special attention or consideration in this context is Leary\u2019s 6-item unidimensional scale [42], which focuses on intellectual humility\u2019s essential features rather than its consequences or behavioral aspects. Leary\u2019s scale is noteworthy since it was developed on the basis of a theoretical consensus among leading virtue epistemology scholars and expert psychologists who study humility. The scale developed by Leary et al. emphasizes the metacognitive core of intellectual humility, which involves recognizing the limits of one\u2019s own knowledge and being aware of one\u2019s own fallibility. Other multidimensional instruments have also incorporated into the construct some socio-behavioral aspects that can be considered distinct virtues, derived from and closely related to intellectual humility, such as modesty, the ability to remain cognitively open to counterarguments (open-mindedness), or respect for other people\u2019s views (intellectual respect), among others. For a more complete comparison of the diverse definitions of intellectual humility and their cognitive emphasis in different scales, see the work of Porter et al. [22]. Recent research has called for studies on intellectual humility to move beyond assessing the trait in isolation and to explore how it interacts with other intellectual virtues to promote a good intellectual character [45]. While several scales have been developed to evaluate individual intellectual virtues, e.g., curiosity [46, 47], open-mindedness [48\u201350], and grit [35], very few studies have comprehensively assessed the notion of a virtuous intellectual character. On the basis of virtue-based self-assessments [16], a 23-item scale that aims to measure virtuous intellectual character (VICS) was recently proposed and validated in Argentina [51]. This instrument focuses on five dimensions of a virtuous intellectual character: (i) attentiveness, (ii) open-mindedness, (iii) curiosity, (iv) carefulness, and (v) intellectual autonomy. On the other hand, it should be noted that, at present, there are no scales specifically designed for measuring a virtuous intellectual character in relation to interdisciplinary work. In 2005, the US National Academy of Sciences [52] operationally defined interdisciplinarity as \u201ca mode of research by teams or individuals that integrates information, data, techniques, tools, perspectives, concepts, and\/or theories from two or more disciplines or bodies of specialized knowledge to advance fundamental understanding or to solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline or area of research practice\" (p. 2). Since then, scholarly interest in measuring the quality of interdisciplinarity has increased. The importance of quality indicators and proper assessment processes for interdisciplinary initiatives has been discussed [53]. Generic evaluation principles [54] and indicators of interdisciplinarity in documents pertaining to the practices employed by research funders and policy-makers have been proposed [55], and the experiences of interdisciplinary researchers have been collected for the purposes of research evaluation [56]. Furthermore, assessments have been developed to measure partial aspects of interdisciplinarity, such as the interdisciplinarity of publications based on bibliometric approaches [57\u201359], the interdisciplinarity of a research system [60], and the disciplinary diversity of interdisciplinary papers [61, 62]. More comprehensively, pathways for assessing interdisciplinary initiatives have also been presented recently on the basis of a systematic review [63]. Thus, numerous studies have proposed different metrics for evaluating interdisciplinary initiatives (e.g., papers, research proposals, and programs), including objective data regarding the researcher\u2019s background (such as the researcher\u2019s field of training, academic affiliation, coauthorships, and citations from other disciplines). However, very little research has focused on developing self-reported assessments of the character traits, expertise, or productivity exhibited by individual researchers in the context of interdisciplinary work. Although some research has focused on this topic, it has emphasized specific areas, such as biomedical sciences or engineering [64, 65]. On a topic more similar to the research on which this paper focuses, three scales for measuring aspects of the collaborative processes of a research center have been developed: (1) perceived satisfaction with collaboration, (2) trust and respect in a collaborative setting, and (3) the impact of collaboration on the research process. These scales were developed and validated by Masse et al. [66] based on a questionnaire administered to 216 researchers at the Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Centers. Items from scales (1) and (2) measure various aspects of the character of interdisciplinary researchers, and in this sense, these scales could be viewed as antecedents of our study. Moreover, in this paper, we have used the scale (3) to evaluate the level of satisfaction regarding the results of interdisciplinary research. In addition, the results of a survey involving 214 early-career researchers from interdisciplinary departments or enrolled in interdisciplinary projects revealed that both context and attitude play important roles in raising awareness, shaping abilities, and reporting interdisciplinary achievements [67]. This survey also supports the relevance of our paper\u2019s goal of developing a more detailed and in-depth evaluation of the intellectual character traits exhibited by interdisciplinary researchers. The general purpose of the investigation presented in this article is to develop a psychometric instrument for assessing the intellectual virtues of researchers that are essential for interdisciplinary inquiry. Accordingly, (i) the instrument is designed, (ii) its validity and reliability are examined, and (iii) the question of whether individuals with significant experience and productivity in interdisciplinary work exhibit high levels of the virtues assessed by the scale is investigated. Two studies were conducted to achieve this general objective. The proposed quantitative tool is essential for evaluating future interventions that may be designed to cultivate the intellectual character necessary for interdisciplinary work among young researchers. The primary objective of Study 1 is to develop a scale for measuring the intellectual virtues associated with interdisciplinary research. On the basis of previous qualitative research conducted by Vanney et al. [20], we aim to create a scale that measures five essential intellectual virtues that are required for interdisciplinary research, namely, (1) intellectual humility, (2) open-mindedness, (3) intellectual perseverance, (4) curiosity, and (5) intellectual empathy. A second objective of this study is to evaluate the new scale\u2019s content, construct, convergent, and discriminant validity, as well as its reliability. The intellectual humility scale by Leary and colleagues [42], the curiosity and open-mindedness subscales of a virtuous intellectual character scale (VICS) by Mesurado and Vanney [51], and the perseverance subscale of the Grit Scale by Duckworth and colleagues [68] will be used to study the convergent validity of the new scale. Existing scales measure intellectual virtues in a general epistemic context, unlike the new scale, which aims to assess the intellectual virtues associated with interdisciplinary research. First, a team of three researchers was formed, including an academic with a background in science and philosophy, particularly in virtue epistemology; a psychologist specializing in psychometrics; and an academic with dual degrees in philosophy and psychology. Based on a thorough review of the virtue epistemology literature, particularly the description of the intellectual virtues required for interdisciplinary research presented in a recent qualitative study [20], six items were developed to evaluate each of three epistemic virtues (open-mindedness, perseverance, and curiosity) in the specific context of interdisciplinary research, and seven items were developed to assess each of the other two intellectual virtues (intellectual humility and intellectual empathy) in an interdisciplinary environment. The initial scale included a total of 32 items. Five researchers who had previous experience conducting interdisciplinary research between the humanities and the natural sciences were contacted to serve as judges. A demographic description of the judges can be found in Table 1. These judges were asked to assess (i) the relevance of the proposed items with respect to each virtue and (ii) the clarity with which the statements were formulated.  \n              https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0312938.t001 Regarding the relevance of the items, the results indicated 100% agreement concerning 26 items and 80% agreement regarding 5 items. Only one item received 40% agreement and was therefore eliminated from subsequent studies. The judges made suggestions concerning ways of clarifying or simplifying the wording of 10 of the items (30%). For example, an original item was: \u201cWhen researching, I accept that criticism from colleagues in other areas can enrich my work,\u201d and the judges suggested changing the verb to emphasize a humble attitude: \u201cWhen researching, I accept that criticism from colleagues in other areas can improve my work.\u201d These modifications were included in the version used for subsequent analyses. Study 1 was conducted with a nonprobabilistic data sample. The authors of this article have directed several interdisciplinary research projects in the last 15 years, so they have 522 researchers from Latin America in their network. To these 522, they also added other scholars belonging to important interdisciplinary research groups from countries in the region obtained through the internet. Thus, to recruit participants, a list of 800 researchers from Latin America was drawn, whose areas of expertise broadly covered the entire spectrum of academic disciplines from the natural and social sciences to the humanities. For Study 1, 400 contacts were emailed, asking them to complete an anonymous online survey and share it with other researchers, following a snowball methodology. The same procedure was used with the remaining 400 contacts for Study 2. The project included an online questionnaire for university teachers and researchers. Since the participants were well educated adults, the online survey was anonymous and contained unidentifiable information, and it did not collect private information from the participants; thus, no IRB application was necessary. Written informed consent was obtained, and all procedures performed in the studies were in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. The recruitment period started on September 5, 2023, and ended on October 5, 2023. In both studies, to determine the final sample, the inclusion criterion was being a professor at a Latin American university. The exclusion criteria were (i) not having completed university studies, (ii) not working at a university or research center, or (iii) doing research or teaching in countries outside Latin America. The sample used for Study 1 included 318 academics between the ages of 24 and 81 years (mean age = 48.58, SD = 12.28); 52.5% of these academics were male, 47.2% were female, and 0.3% were nonbinary. In terms of the highest educational level attained by the participants, 14.7% had completed a university education, 25.5% had completed studies for a specialization or a master\u2019s degree, 38.7% had completed doctoral studies, and 21.1% had completed postdoctoral studies. Additionally, 11.3% of the participants reported performing teaching work, 27.1% reported performing disciplinary research, 20.1% reported performing interdisciplinary research, and 41.5% reported performing both types of research (disciplinary and interdisciplinary). Webpower online software was used to determine the sample size\u2019s statistical power using the procedure suggested by Satorr & Saris [69]. The effect size was 0.1, the significance level (alpha) was 0.05, the sample size was 318, and the degree of freedom was 210, resulting in a sample size\u2019s statistical power of .43. Moreover, a power analysis based on the RMSEA [70] was also performed via Webpower software. The RMSEA H0 was 0, the RMSEA H1 was 0.05, the significance level (alpha) was 0.05, the sample size was 318, and the degree of freedom was 210, resulting in a sample size of statistical power of 1. Intellectual Virtues for Interdisciplinary Research Scale (IVIRS). This scale included 31 items at this stage because one item was discarded in accordance with the judges\u2019 suggestion, as indicated above. This initial version of the instrument aimed to measure (i) intellectual humility (6 items, e.g., \u2018When researching, I am willing to acknowledge mistakes based on evidence provided by colleagues from other disciplines\u2019), (ii) open-mindedness (6 items, e.g., \u2018When researching, I am willing to change what I think after an exchange with colleagues from other disciplines\u2019), (iii) perseverance (6 items, e.g., \u2018When working with people from other fields, I strive to reach the end goal even though interdisciplinary work is arduous\u2019), (iv) curiosity (6 items, e.g., \u2018When researching, I am curious to learn how things are explained in different disciplines\u2019), and (v) intellectual empathy (7 items, e.g., \u2018When working with people from other fields, I try to understand how they reach certain conclusions\u2019). A 5-point Likert scale (ranging from \u2018very much\u2019 = 5 to \u2018not at all\u2019 = 1) is used to score each item. Intellectual Humility Scale. Leary and colleagues [42] developed a 6-item scale to measure intellectual humility. This unidimensional instrument includes items such as \u2018In the face of conflicting evidence, I am open to changing my opinions\u2019. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from \u2018not at all like me\u2019 = 1 to \u2018very much like me\u2019 = 5. The total score is obtained by taking the average of the scores for each item included in the scale. A high score indicates a high level of intellectual humility. The McDonald\u2019s omega coefficient (\u03c9) for the Intellectual Humility Scale was \u03c9 = .77. Virtuous Intellectual Character Scale (VICS). On the basis of virtue-based self-assessments [16], a 23-item scale validated by Mesurado and Vanney [51] was used to measure intellectual virtues in a general epistemic context. The VICS measures five intellectual virtues: (1) intellectual autonomy, (2) attentiveness, (3) carefulness, (4) curiosity, and (5) open-mindedness. For this study, only two subscales of this instrument were used: the 6-item curiosity subscale (with a McDonald\u2019s omega coefficient of .80) and the 5-item open-mindedness subscale (with a McDonald\u2019s omega coefficient of .79). A 5-point Likert scale (ranging from \u2018very much\u2019 = 5 to \u2018not at all\u2019 = 1) is used to score each item. The subscale score is obtained by taking the average of the scores for each of the items of which the subscale is composed. A high score indicates a high level of curiosity or open-mindedness. Grit scale. Duckworth and colleagues developed both a long version and a short version of the Grit Scale to measure perseverance and passion with respect to long-term goals [34, 36]. Both versions of this scale exhibit a 2-factor structure, including the Consistency of Interests Over Time (e.g., the reverse-scored item \u2018I often set a goal but later choose to pursue a different one\u2019) and the Perseverance of Effort (e.g., \u2018I have achieved a goal that took years of work\u2019). For this study, we used the long Spanish version of the Grit Scale [68], although we employed only the perseverance of effort subscale. The McDonald\u2019s omega coefficient (\u03c9) for this subscale was .70. Each item is scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from \u2018strongly disagree\u2019 = 1 to \u2018strongly agree\u2019 = 5. Initially, outliers (values that deviate significantly from the mean) were analyzed, and then Mardia\u2019s test was performed to evaluate multivariate skewness and kurtosis. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using principal axis factoring with Oblimin rotation was conducted to study construct validity. The variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance were used to evaluate the collinearity of the items. Two procedures were used to study convergent validity: (1) the average variance extracted (AVE) index indicates how well the observed variables (items) represent the latent construct (in this case, virtues). An AVE value of 0.50 or higher is considered adequate. This means that at least 50% of the variance of the indicators is explained by the latent construct, indicating good convergent validity [71]. (2) The second procedure used to study convergent validity was a correlation analysis to investigate the relationships of the new Intellectual Virtues for Interdisciplinary Research Scale (IVIRS) with other scales: the Intellectual Humility Scale [42], the perseverance of effort subscale of the Grit Scale [68], and the open-mindedness and curiosity subscales of the Virtuous Intellectual Character Scale (VICS) [51]. Moreover, the heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio of the correlations was used to test discriminant validity. \u201cThe HTMT is defined as the mean value of the item correlations across constructs relative to the (geometric) mean of the average correlations for the items measuring the same construct\u201d [71]. HTMT values above 0.90 suggest a lack of discriminant validity for structural models with highly conceptually related constructs, and HTMT values above 0.85 suggest a lack of discriminant validity for structural models with highly conceptually unrelated constructs. Finally, the reliability was calculated with respect to McDonald\u2019s omega coefficient (\u03c9) and corrected item-total correlations, which are used to assess the strength of the relationship between each item and the instrument\u2019s total score. All these analyses were conducted via SPSS 29 software. Initially, SPSS software was used to identify outliers for each item among the 318 cases included in the dataset. An average of 4 outlier values were found per item. Because the results did not significantly change when the outliers were removed, the outliers were retained. Moreover, Mardia\u2019s test was performed to assess multivariate skewness and kurtosis via JASP software. The results of Mardia\u2019s test indicated that the results were not normally distributed, with a skewness of 74.86 (p \u2264 .001) and kurtosis of 594.56 (p \u2264 .001). An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) using principal axis factoring with Oblimin rotation was conducted via SPSS. The Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin (KMO) coefficient thus obtained was .94, and Bartlett\u2019s test of sphericity indicated a value of 3785.19, df = 210, p \u2264 .001; these values suggest that the relationships among the items included in the IVIRS were sufficiently strong to proceed with the following analysis [72]. Four factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 were identified, and the scree plot also suggested four factors or dimensions (Fig 1). Moreover, following the suggestions of Worthington and Whittaker [73], we decided to preserve factors that exhibited a variance higher than 10% and were composed of at least three items. Similarly, we preserved items that exhibited a loading equal to or greater than .35.  \n              https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0312938.g001 A scale covering four dimensions and including 21 items resulted in factor loadings ranging between .35 and .89 and explained 57.63% of the total variance. Although the existence of 5 dimensions was initially postulated, exploratory analyses confirmed the existence of the following 4 dimensions: (1) intellectual empathy, (2) perseverance, (3) open-mindedness and intellectual humility, and (4) curiosity. As it was not possible to differentiate the items used to measure open-mindedness from those used to measure humility, these notions were combined into one dimension. Table 2 shows the factor loading for each item. Factor loading for each item (Study 1).\n Factor loading for each item (Study 1). \n              https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0312938.t002 Finally, the variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance were used to evaluate the collinearity of the items. Table 2 shows that all the VIF values obtained were lower than 5, and the tolerance values were greater than .20, suggesting ideal values of collinearity [71]. The average variance extracted (AVE) index was calculated to study the convergent validity of the new instrument. The values obtained were Factor 1: intellectual empathy, AVE = .46; Factor 2: open-mindedness and humility, AVE = .38; Factor 3: perseverance, AVE = .54; and Factor 4: curiosity, AVE = .46. The factors had slightly lower AVE values compared to those suggested in the literature, with the exception of factor 3, perseverance. Moreover, to study the convergent validity of the new instrument, a correlation analysis was conducted to explore the relationships between the IVIRS with other scales: (1) the Intellectual Humility Scale, (2) the curiosity and (3) open-mindedness subscales of the VICS, and (4) the perseverance of effort subscale of the Grit Scale. The results indicated moderate and robust associations among the total score on the IVIRS, its subscales, and the measures used to evaluate intellectual virtues (intellectual humility, curiosity, open-mindedness, and perseverance) in a general epistemic context. Table 3 shows the Pearson coefficients for all the variables included in the study.  \n              https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0312938.t003 The heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio of the correlations was used to evaluate discriminant validity. The HTMT criterion between Factor 1, intellectual empathy and Factor 2, open-mindedness\/humility, was .69; Factor 1, intellectual empathy, and Factor 3, perseverance, was .79; Factor 1, intellectual empathy and Factor 4, curiosity, was .74; Factor 3, perseverance and Factor 2, open-mindedness\/humility, was .71; Factor 3, perseverance and Factor 4, curiosity, was .67; and finally, Factor 2, open-mindedness\/humility and Factor 4, curiosity, was .78. No HTMT value was found above .85 or .90, suggesting the presence of discriminant validity. First, we calculated item-total correlations for all the items included in the new IVIRS. The corrected item-total correlations exceeded .51 for all the items, and the highest item-total correlation was .75. See Table 4. Second, McDonald\u2019s omega coefficient (\u03c9) for the total score of the scale was .94 and .87 for the intellectual empathy subscale, .89 for the perseverance subscale, .83 for the open-mindedness-humility subscale, and .86 for the curiosity subscale, thus indicating an exceptional degree of reliability.  \n              https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0312938.t004 The main objectives of Study 2 were twofold: First, to validate the 4-factor structure of the Intellectual Virtues for Interdisciplinary Research Scale (IVIRS). In addition, we explore convergent validity via the AVE and the relationship between the intellectual virtues required to conduct interdisciplinary research and those required in a general epistemic context to provide additional evidence regarding the validity of the IVIRS. Moreover, discriminant validity and reliability were calculated. Second, to determine whether, on the one hand, participants who had significant experience and productivity in interdisciplinary work (objective index) presented high levels of the intellectual virtues required for interdisciplinary research and, on the other hand, participants with a significant level of satisfaction regarding the results of their interdisciplinary research (subjective index) also presented high levels of these virtues. For this second objective, the following hypotheses were formulated: The same data collection procedure described in Study 1 was used in Study 2. The recruitment period started on October 20, 2023, and ended on December 1, 2023. The Study 2 sample initially included 318 participants. However, 21 participants were excluded because they did not meet some of the inclusion criteria described in Study 1. The final sample included 297 academics between the ages of 24 and 80 years (mean age = 49.20, SD = 12.06); 52.2% of the participants were male, whereas 47.8% were female. In terms of the highest educational level attained by the participants, 15.5% had completed a university education, 25.3% had completed a specialization degree or a master\u2019s degree, 39.1% had completed doctoral studies, and 20.2% had completed postdoctoral studies. Additionally, 15.2% of the participants reported performing teaching work, 26.3% reported performing disciplinary research, 15.5% reported performing interdisciplinary research, and 43.1% reported performing both types of research (disciplinary and interdisciplinary). Table 5 shows descriptive information about the participants\u2019 interdisciplinary academic background.  \n              https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0312938.t005 Intellectual Virtues for Interdisciplinary Research Scale (IVIRS). The 21-item Intellectual Virtues for Interdisciplinary Research Scale (IVIRS), validated as part of Study 1, was used to measure the possession of a virtuous intellectual character regarding interdisciplinary research. The scale measures 4 factors or dimensions: (1) intellectual empathy, (2) open-mindedness and intellectual humility, (3) perseverance, and (4) curiosity. All the items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from \u2018very much\u2019 = 5 to \u2018not at all\u2019 = 1). The score for each subscale is obtained by calculating the average of the scores attributed by the participants to the set of items of which the subscale in question is composed. The total score is obtained by calculating the average of the scores attributed by the participants to all the items. Higher scores indicate a higher level of the virtue under investigation. See S1 Appendix. Intellectual Humility Scale. The 6-item scale developed by Leary and colleagues [42] was used to measure intellectual humility. The McDonald\u2019s omega coefficient (\u03c9) for the Intellectual Humility Scale was .76. Virtuous Intellectual Character Scale (VICS). Curiosity and open-mindedness were measured via subscales of the Virtuous Intellectual Character Scale (VICS), which was developed by Mesurado and Vanney [51] on the basis of virtue-based self-assessments [16]. The McDonald\u2019s omega coefficients (\u03c9) for the open-mindedness and curiosity subscales were .76 and .71, respectively. Grit scale. Perseverance was measured via the Spanish version [68] of the subscale perseverance of effort of the Grit Scale, which was developed by [35, 36]. The McDonald\u2019s omega coefficient (\u03c9) was .71. Interdisciplinary Work Index. We created an index that evaluates the participant\u2019s level of experience and productivity in interdisciplinary research. This index includes a set of ad hoc questions (6 items) that collect objective information about the participant\u2019s interdisciplinary background (see Table 5). For example, \u2018In how many disciplines have you received systematic education?\u2019 or \u2018In how many interdisciplinary research projects have you participated?\u2019. The response options included none, one, two, three, or more than three. The six items were assigned weighting factors proportional to the duration and intensity of the interdisciplinary experience. For example, the question \u2018In how many conferences, workshops, etc., on interdisciplinary topics have you participated?\u2019 was assigned a weighting factor of 1, whereas the question \u2018How many papers have you published in the context of interdisciplinary coauthorship?\u2019 was assigned a weighting factor of 2. Similarly, the question \u2018In how many disciplines have you received systematic education?\u2019 was assigned a weighting factor of 3, the question \u2018How many papers have you published in journals outside your native discipline?\u2019 was assigned a weighting factor of 4, and the question \u2018How many of your publications have been cited in journals from disciplines other than your native discipline?\u2019 was assigned a weighting factor of 5. See S2 Appendix. Impact of Collaboration Scale. The 5-item Impact of Collaboration Scale developed by Masse et al. [66] was used to evaluate the participant\u2019s level of satisfaction regarding the results of interdisciplinary research. Three items were used to evaluate the level of satisfaction regarding team productivity (e.g., \u2018Meeting productivity\u2019 was measured via 6 response options, including 0 = not applicable and a range extending from 1 = very low to 5 = excellent), and two items were used to assess whether interdisciplinary research had improved the participant\u2019s individual productivity and research quality (e.g., \u2018Overall, interdisciplinary collaboration has improved the productivity of my research\u2019, which was scored by reference to 6 response options, including 0 = not applicable and a range extending from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). The McDonald\u2019s omega coefficient (\u03c9) for the Impact of Collaboration Scale was .96. Initially, Mardia\u2019s test was used to evaluate multivariate skewness and kurtosis via JASP software. To confirm the 4-factor structure of the IVIRS, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted with the assistance of Mplus software. The chi-square (\u03c72), ratio of \u03c72 to degrees of freedom (\u03c72\/df), comparative fit index (CFI), and Tucker\u2012Lewis index (TLI) were used as adjustment indices for the model. Hu and Bentler [74] proposed that CFI and TLI values equal to or greater than .95 indicate good adjustment indices. Furthermore, the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) were used to measure errors. Hu and Bentler [74] identified values close to .06 as indicating an acceptable level of error. The variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance were used to evaluate the collinearity of the items. We planned to replicate the convergent validity study previously conducted in Study 1 with reference to a different sample. For this purpose, we performed the average variance extracted (AVE) index and correlation analysis among the IVIRS and other scales that measure open-mindedness and curiosity (two subscales of the VICS), intellectual humility, and perseverance of effort (subscale of the Grit Scale). Moreover, the heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio of the correlations was used to test discriminant validity. Additionally, we calculated the reliability with reference to McDonald\u2019s omega coefficient (\u03c9). To test the hypotheses included in Study 2, the total sample was divided twice into three groups according to the results obtained by the participants (i) in the Interdisciplinary Work Index (objective index) and (ii) in the Impact of Collaboration Scale (subjective index) developed by Masse [66]. According to the Interdisciplinary Work Index, the 3 groups are: (1) participants with low levels of experience and productivity (25th percentile), (2) participants with high levels of experience and productivity (75th percentile), and (3) participants with moderate levels of experience and productivity. The three comparison groups were used because it is easier to establish a clear contrast between different levels of the variable (e.g., low, medium, and high). In turn, this facilitates the interpretation of the results and the observation of sharper patterns in performance variation between groups. Three groups provide a balance between having sufficient comparisons and maintaining clarity of results without adding unnecessary complexity. If the groups were divided into more than three, it is more likely that one of the subgroups would be too small to be compared, which may limit the validity of the statistical results. Four groups may spread participants further apart, reducing the size of each group and decreasing statistical power. In summary, dividing into three groups to compare performance allows for a clearer and more manageable analysis, while minimizing statistical noise and facilitating interpretation of the results. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was then performed using levels of experience and productivity (low, medium, and high) as independent variables and the total IVIRS score as the dependent variable. Moreover, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was also performed using levels of experience and productivity (low, medium, and high) as independent variables and the 4 subscales of the IVIRS as dependent variables. The objective of these analyses was to determine whether individuals who presented significant levels of experience and productivity in interdisciplinary work (objective index) had also presented higher levels of the intellectual virtues pertaining to interdisciplinarity. Finally, according to the Impact of Collaboration Scale (subjective index), the total sample was divided once again into three groups: (1) participants with low levels of satisfaction regarding the results of their interdisciplinary research (25th percentile), (2) participants with high levels of satisfaction (75th percentile), and (3) participants with moderate levels of satisfaction. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were performed, with the level of satisfaction regarding the results of their interdisciplinary research (subjective index) as the independent variable and the total IVIRS score or the 4 subscales of the IVIRS score as the dependent variable. To perform these analyses, we used SPSS 29 software and conducted ANOVA, MANOVA, correlation, and McDonald\u2019s omega coefficient (\u03c9) analyses. Study 2 aimed to confirm the 4-factor structure of the IVIRS found in Study 1. Initially, Mardia\u2019s test was performed to assess multivariate skewness and kurtosis. The results of Mardia\u2019s test indicated that the results were not normally distributed, with a skewness of 72.74 (p \u2264 .001) and kurtosis of 584.85 (p \u2264 .001). A confirmatory factor analysis using maximum likelihood parameter estimates with standard errors and a mean-adjusted chi-square test statistic, which is robust to nonnormality, was performed to test the theoretical model, which indicated that the model exhibited an excellent fit, \u03c72 = 273.70, df = 183, p \u2264. 001, \u03c72\/df = 3.41, CFI = .97, TLI = .96, SRMR = .04, RMSEA = .04 (90% CI: 03-.05). Fig 2 presents the estimated value alongside the significance level for each item included in the new scale.  \n              https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0312938.g002 Moreover, the variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance were used to evaluate the collinearity of the items. Table 5 shows that all the VIF values obtained with the second participant sample were also lower than 5, and the tolerance values were greater than .20, suggesting ideal values of collinearity [71, 75]. See Table 6.  \n              https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0312938.t006 The average variance extracted (AVE) index was calculated to study the convergent validity of the new instrument. The values obtained were Factor 1: intellectual empathy, AVE = .51; Factor 2: perseverance, AVE = .56; Factor 3: open-mindedness and humility, AVE = .49; and Factor 4: curiosity, AVE = .63. All the factors obtained good AVE values except for the open-mindedness\u2012humility factor, which had slightly lower AVE values than those suggested by the literature. Moreover, to confirm the convergent validity of the IVIRS with respect to a new and independent sample, a correlation analysis was conducted with respect to the new IVIRS and other scales: (1) the Intellectual Humility Scale, (2) the curiosity subscale and (3) the open-mindedness subscale of the VICS, and (4) the perseverance subscale of the Grit Scale. As in Study 1, the results indicated moderate and robust associations among the total score of the IVIRS, its subscales, and other scales that measure intellectual virtues (intellectual humility, curiosity, open-mindedness, and perseverance) in a general epistemic context. Table 7 shows the Pearson coefficients for all the variables included in the study.  \n              https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0312938.t007 The heterotrait-monotrait (HTMT) ratio of the correlations was used to test discriminant validity. The HTMT criterion between Factor 1, intellectual empathy, and Factor 2, perseverance, was .79; Factor 1, intellectual empathy, and Factor 3, open-mindedness\/humility, was .75; Factor 1, intellectual empathy, and Factor 4, curiosity, was .75; Factor 2, perseverance, and Factor 3, open-mindedness\/humility, was .76; Factor 2, perseverance, and Factor 4, curiosity, was .73; and lastly, Factor 3, open-mindedness\/humility, and Factor 4, curiosity, was .80. No HTMT value was found above .85 or .90, suggesting the presence of discriminant validity. Finally, in Study 2, the McDonald\u2019s omega coefficient (\u03c9) for the total score of the scale was .94, and the corresponding coefficients were .85 for the intellectual empathy subscale, .86 for the perseverance subscale, .84 for the open-mindedness and intellectual humility subscale, and .88 for the curiosity subscale, which indicate the exceptional reliability of the scale. The second objective of Study 2 was to determine whether individuals with significant experience and productivity in interdisciplinary work (objective index) also present high levels of the intellectual virtues required for interdisciplinary research. As it was mentioned previously, to achieve this goal, the total sample was split into three groups (low, moderate or high levels of experience and productivity according to the Interdisciplinary Work Index). The frequency with which the participants were included in different groups and the mean and standard deviation of the level of intellectual virtues for interdisciplinary research for each group are presented in Table 8.  \n              https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0312938.t008 The results indicated that participants with significant levels of experience and productivity in the context of interdisciplinary work also presented high levels of the intellectual virtues required for interdisciplinary research [F (2, 296) = 22.13, p <. 001, eta = .20 (95% CI = .06, .20)]. The Bonferroni post hoc test indicated that participants with significant levels of experience and productivity in interdisciplinarity also presented higher levels of the intellectual virtues required for interdisciplinary research than did participants who had moderate (\u03b2 = .26, 95% CI = .10, .43) or low levels (\u03b2 = .51, 95% CI = .33, .70) of experience and productivity. In addition, participants with moderate levels of experience and productivity in interdisciplinary work presented higher levels of these intellectual virtues than did participants with low levels of experience and productivity (\u03b2 = .25, 95% CI = .08, .41). A MANOVA was subsequently performed using levels of experience and productivity (high, medium, and low) as independent variables and the 4 subscales of the IVIRS as dependent variables. The goal of this analysis was to investigate whether the general differences between the level of experience and productivity in interdisciplinarity and the level of the intellectual virtues required for interdisciplinary research were maintained when each dimension of the IVIRS was analyzed separately. The results indicated significant differences in MANOVA Hotelling\u2019s Trace F (8, 580) = 8.41, p < .001, eta = .09. Moreover, differences were found among the 4 factors of the IVIRS: intellectual empathy [F (2, 294) = 9.68, p <. 001, eta = .06], perseverance [F (2, 294) = 24.59, p <. 001, eta = .14], open-mindedness-humility [F (2, 294) = 14.56, p <. 001, eta = .09], and curiosity [F (2, 294) = 15.37, p < .001, eta = .10]. The Bonferroni post hoc test indicated that participants with high levels of experience and productivity in interdisciplinary research also exhibited higher levels of open-mindedness and intellectual humility, intellectual empathy, perseverance, and curiosity than did participants with moderate or low levels of experience and productivity. In addition, participants with moderate levels of experience and productivity presented higher levels of open-mindedness and intellectual humility, intellectual empathy, perseverance, and curiosity than did participants with low levels of experience and productivity. See Table 8. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to determine whether participants who had a significant level of satisfaction regarding the results of their interdisciplinary research (subjective index) also presented high levels of the intellectual virtues required for interdisciplinary research. The results indicated that participants with significant levels of satisfaction also presented high levels of the intellectual virtues [F (2, 296) = 30.56, p <. 001, eta = .17 (95% CI = .10, .25)]. The Bonferroni post hoc test indicated that participants with significant levels of satisfaction also presented higher levels of the intellectual virtues than did participants who had moderate (\u03b2 = .30, 95% CI = .14, .47) or low levels (\u03b2 = .59, 95% CI = .41, .78) of satisfaction. In addition, participants with moderate levels of satisfaction presented higher levels of the intellectual virtues than did participants with low levels of satisfaction (\u03b2 = .29, 95% CI = .13, .45). A MANOVA was subsequently performed using the level of satisfaction (high, medium, and low) as independent variable and the 4 subscales of the IVIRS as dependent variables. The goal of this analysis was to investigate whether the general differences between the level of satisfaction and the level of each intellectual virtue were maintained when each dimension of the IVIRS was analyzed separately. The results indicated significant differences in MANOVA Hotelling\u2019s Trace F (8, 580) = 8.30, p < .001, eta = .10. Moreover, differences were found among the 4 factors of the IVIRS: intellectual empathy [F (2, 294) = 18.87, p <. 001, eta = .11], perseverance [F (2, 294) = 27.40, p <. 001, eta = .16], open-mindedness-humility [F (2, 294) = 22.23, p <. 001, eta = .13], and curiosity [F (2, 294) = 18.53, p <. 001, eta = .11]. The Bonferroni post hoc test indicated that participants with significant levels of satisfaction also presented higher levels of open-mindedness and intellectual humility, intellectual empathy, perseverance, and curiosity than did participants with moderate or low levels of satisfaction. Additionally, participants with moderate levels of satisfaction presented higher levels of open-mindedness, intellectual humility, intellectual empathy, perseverance, and curiosity than did participants with low levels of satisfaction. See Table 9.  \n              https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0312938.t009 This research makes a significant contribution by designing and validating a psychometric tool to assess crucial intellectual virtues that researchers must possess for interdisciplinarity. The proposal\u2019s novelty lies in conducting an empirical investigation on the basis of the theoretical framework of virtue epistemology, thus bridging the gap between empirical psychology and philosophy. Although there are several scales for assessing some intellectual virtues individually, very few instruments evaluate intellectual character comprehensively, i.e., including several epistemic virtues in the same construct. Moreover, assessing the specific features of interdisciplinary researchers\u2019 intellectual character offers groundbreaking insights as they provide an empirical approach to evaluating the relationship dynamics between the challenges posed by interdisciplinarity and some epistemic virtues, understood as traits of a virtuous intellectual character. The scale is valuable because it can be a key initial step in promoting interdisciplinarity by focusing on developing specific qualities in researchers. On the basis of the results obtained by Vanney and colleagues [20], who carried out a qualitative study to identify the intellectual virtues that scholars should possess to undertake successful interdisciplinary projects, we initially chose five intellectual virtues as part of our new scale: (1) intellectual humility, (2) open-mindedness, (3) intellectual perseverance, (4) curiosity, and (5) intellectual empathy. However, the EFA conducted for Study 1 identified only four dimensions, as the pools of items that were initially developed to measure intellectual humility and open-mindedness converged into a unique factor. In turn, the confirmatory factor analysis conducted for Study 2 corroborated the four-dimensional structure observed in Study 1. Therefore, the new instrument has four conceptually and empirically differentiated dimensions. First, the \"intellectual empathy\" dimension was the most decisive factor on the scale. The findings suggest that intellectual empathy is crucial for comprehending the cognitive process of researchers from other fields. Indeed, interdisciplinary work requires understanding how other researchers think, their methodological approach, and how they arrive at their conclusions. It is necessary to adopt the way in which other researchers approach a question and follow their reasoning methods. The \"open-mindedness and intellectual humility\" was the second relevant dimension. Successful interdisciplinary research requires being open-minded to different perspectives, taking into account findings from various fields, being willing to adjust one\u2019s beliefs when necessary, trusting the expertise of others, accepting criticism from others, and acknowledging one\u2019s own mistakes. The third factor was \"intellectual perseverance.\" To achieve success in interdisciplinarity, one must reach the end goal through arduous work, strive despite encountering difficulties, avoid becoming discouraged, and find ways of overcoming challenges. It is essential to persist until one has obtained some understanding of the language, methodology, and perspectives of the other disciplines involved in the research. Lastly, \"curiosity\" was the fourth dimension. Curiosity concerning the problems and approaches associated with disciplines other than one\u2019s own could represent a fundamental prerequisite for beginning an interdisciplinary inquiry as well as a motivation for sustaining work over time. Interdisciplinary research involves curiosity about how different disciplines approach the topic under study, enthusiasm concerning the contributions of various fields, and interest in their explanations. Furthermore, interdisciplinarity requires researchers to value discussions with scholars from other areas as a stimulus for new questions that can, in turn, lead to new ideas. Our results revealed an overlap between intellectual humility and open-mindedness, indicating that these virtues are not empirically distinguished in IVIRS. Although these two epistemic virtues have been distinguished theoretically [76] and empirically [42], the differences between them are subtle. At its metacognitive core, intellectual humility involves recognizing the limits of one\u2019s own knowledge and being aware of one\u2019s own fallibility. On the other hand, open-mindedness involves fairly or impartially considering diverse perspectives, which does not necessarily require the assumption of the limitations of one\u2019s own beliefs. However, in an interdisciplinary research context, these two virtues act in conjunction and reinforce each other. In fact, some IVIRS items incorporate elements of both. For example, in item 1 (originally intellectual humility), \"When researching, I am willing to acknowledge mistakes based on evidence provided by other disciplines,\" the humble attitude implies a prior openness to evidence from other disciplines. Likewise, in item 6 (originally open-mindedness), \"When researching, I am open to considering results from other disciplines even if they are not consistent with those achieved by my field,\u201d the open-minded attitude assumes a prior humble recognition that the knowledge of one\u2019s own discipline is not absolute. In addition, Studies 1 and 2 also analyzed the associations of the IVIRS with other scales that measure intellectual virtues (open-mindedness, curiosity, intellectual humility, and perseverance) in a general epistemic context. For example, the Virtuous Intellectual Character Scale [51] assesses open-mindedness with the item \u2018I am open to considering new evidence\u2019 that may refer to the same discipline. In contrast, the IVIRS item \u2018When researching, I am open to taking into account perspectives from other disciplines\u2019 requires an open disposition also about other fields. Concerning intellectual humility, in the scale developed by Leary [42], the item \u2018I accept that my beliefs and attitudes may be wrong\u2019 may apply to the disciplinary domain, while the IVIRS item \u2018When I do research, I am willing to acknowledge mistakes based on evidence from colleagues in other disciplines\u2019 demands a deeper humble attitude that includes other disciplines as well. The same applies to perseverance. Assessing tenacity, the item \u2018I have overcome setbacks to conquer an important challenge\u2019 from the Grit Scale [36] may apply within a disciplinary context, while the IVIRS item \u2018When researching, I look for ways to overcome the difficulties caused by interdisciplinarity\u2019 makes perseverance explicitly refer to interdisciplinarity. The results indicate moderate and robust associations between the IVIRS and different scales that measure virtues in a general epistemic context, providing further evidence to support the validity of the new scale with reference to two different samples. Importantly, as can be seen in Tables 3 and 7, in most cases, the levels of association between intellectual virtues in the interdisciplinary context (measured with IVIRS) and the same virtue assessed in a general epistemic context (measured with other instruments) are stronger correlations. In contrast, the level of association between different virtues tends to be slightly lower. For example, Table 7 shows that the level of correlation between the assessment of curiosity (measured with IVIRS and with VICS) is .54, while the levels of association between curiosity (measured with IVIRS) and other intellectual virtues (humility, open-mindedness, and perseverance of effort) measured with other instruments drop to .22-.47. In both Studies 1 and 2, the correlation levels obtained are moderate indicating no overlap between the measures. That is, in the IVIRS measurements, the characteristics of the virtues are preserved, although they make explicit reference to the interdisciplinary context. Moreover, the HTMT ratio of the correlations confirmed the discriminant validity, indicating no overlap between the items within the factor. That is, each of the items provides information about a different aspect of a virtue. Furthermore, Study 2 also demonstrated that researchers with considerable expertise, productivity, and satisfaction in the context of interdisciplinary investigation (measured via objective and subjective indices) presented elevated levels of the intellectual virtues previously identified. This finding was evident both in their overall scores on the assessment of intellectual virtues\u2014i.e., researcher intellectual character\u2014and in the scores associated with each of the virtues individually\u2014i.e., open-mindedness and intellectual humility, intellectual empathy, intellectual perseverance, and curiosity. In contrast, the study also revealed that researchers who had (i) only limited interdisciplinary experience and productivity (objective index) and (ii) a low level of satisfaction regarding the results of their interdisciplinary collaboration (subjective index) presented lower levels of the virtues analyzed. Once again, this finding was reflected in both the overall and the individual scores for each virtue. The results of Study 2 are consistent with theoretical proposals previously developed in virtue epistemology [31, 39, 40, 77, 78]. In summary, both Study 1 and Study 2 provided strong evidence to support the internal consistency of the IVIRS, which is a reliable scale whether the overall score is used or whether each of its four dimensions or subscales are utilized separately, i.e., (i) open-mindedness and intellectual humility, (ii) intellectual empathy, (iii) intellectual perseverance, and (iv) curiosity. The participants in the studies reported in this paper were researchers from Latin America, which limits the generalizability of the conclusions. Although contemporary research is highly globalized, sociocultural characteristics may have influenced the results of these studies. For example, it is possible that the relevance of intellectual empathy is greater in cultures in which warm interpersonal relationships are highly valued, such as Latin American cultures. It would be desirable for this research to inspire follow-up studies that can test the generalizability of the results with reference to populations that were not analyzed in this investigation. According to the literature [79], the invariance analysis is important since it allows us to demonstrate that a measurement could be replicated in groups with different characteristics. In future studies, it would be interesting to consider gender, research areas, years of experience in interdisciplinarity, and cultural contexts to study the structural and measurement invariance of the new scale. The investigation presented in this article elucidates the intellectual character of interdisciplinary researchers by analyzing the intellectual virtues that they must possess to work effectively alongside colleagues from diverse fields. Some character traits are found to be essential and crucial with respect to increasing the productivity and impact of collaboration. On the one hand, this research highlights new opportunities to foster collaborative inquiry in fields that, by their very nature, are interdisciplinary, such as cognitive science, climate change, or science and religion. To date, the most significant efforts in these fields have focused on promoting and consolidating organizational structures that can facilitate interdisciplinarity, such as adequate infrastructure, community building, institutional policies, and funding. However, although all these efforts are necessary, the results of this research indicate that further effort is needed. Perhaps the time has come to move in a new direction by focusing more closely on the development of people\u2019s qualities than on the capacities of institutions since, after all, people, not disciplines, are the actors who engage in dialog. On the other hand, this paper also paves the way for future studies that seek to enhance the intellectual character of interdisciplinary researchers, for example, by developing interventions and training programs. To analyze the effectiveness of such initiatives, instruments such as the one designed and validated here will be indispensable. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0312938.s001 (DOCX) https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0312938.s002 (DOCX) For more information about PLOS Subject Areas, click\n        here.

The firm, which was set up by the one-time banker in 1976, was among a host of industrial holding companies on the Irish stock market at the time, including IWP International, James Crean and Fitzwilton. While the others would disappear over the next decade or so through break-ups and take-private deals \u2014 DCC would drop its Irish listing in 2013 for a sole quotation in London \u2014 the group has long stood out as an anomaly among Irish plcs, decades after global investors had tired of multi-industry groups and started to apply the dreaded \u201cconglomerate discount\u201d. Tommy Breen, who succeeded Flavin, set out a decade ago to simplify the investment case around DCC. He sold its food and beverage assets, including the Robert Roberts tea and coffee and Kelkin health foods brands, as well as a frozen and chilled foods logistics business in 2014, and its environmental unit, covering recycling and waste management, three years later. But now Breen\u2019s successor, Donal Murphy, has decided to finish the job, announcing plans on Tuesday to exit two of DCC\u2019s remaining businesses \u2014 healthcare and technology \u2014 to double down on energy. The board has hired investment bankers in JP Morgan to sell DCC Healthcare, which is made up of two businesses: DCC Vital, which sells medical products and devices to doctors and hospitals, and DCC Health & Beauty Solutions which focuses on developing and manufacturing nutritional supplements such as vitamin gummies and beauty products for brand owners. DCC has encountered challenges expanding the healthcare businesses in recent times through acquisition, coming up against private equity bidders willing to pay way more for deals. Murphy has concluded that if you can\u2019t beat them, you might as well sell to them. Analysts estimate the health unit could fetch as much as \u00a31.5bn, and the technology business, subject to Murphy hitting his maximum profit-boost target, up to a further \u00a31.6bn  The group has also called time on DCC Technology, which sells everything from audiovisual equipment for events companies to consumer electronics. However, Murphy reckons he can secure \u201ca substantial prize\u201d of as much as \u00a330 million (\u20ac36 million) in additional profits in this unit over the next 12 to 18 months through an operational improvement programme \u2014 before hoisting the \u201cfor sale\u201d sign. Analysts estimate the health unit could fetch as much as \u00a31.5 billion, and the technology business, subject to Murphy hitting his maximum profit-boost target, up to a further \u00a31.6 billion. He has pledged to return surplus cash to shareholders. DCC\u2019s share price market spiked by more than 17 per cent on Tuesday to a six-month high of over \u00a358 to give the company a market value of \u00a35.8 billion. It has held on to most of those gains. Analysts have cheered the development, with Deutsche Bank\u2019s David Brockton saying it was a \u201cbold decision\u201d that should push the stock higher as its complexity is reduced and investors remove a conglomerate discount \u2014 a tendency to value a diversified group of business below the sum of its parts. Jefferies number cruncher Ryan Flight described it as the \u201chard catalyst we have been waiting for\u201d to unlock value in the company. It\u2019s a decision that hasn\u2019t been taken lightly. DCC had long resisted pressure to simplify its story, arguing that being in multiple sectors reduced overall earnings volatility. It\u2019s served the group well as it has delivered an average of 14 per cent compound growth in operating profits since it floated 30 years ago. Still, the energy unit had been the standout success over the past decade, with compound average profit growth of 16.4 per cent. It now accounts for almost three-quarters of group earnings. Most of its profits have been coming from the sale of fossil fuels, including oil and gas for household heating and fuel pumped through its 1,175 petrol stations across Scandinavia, France, Britain and Ireland. However, stock market investors have been unwilling to buy into the green future that DCC Energy has been pushing in recent years. The complex structure of the group hasn\u2019t helped. Something had to give. DCC also plans to accelerate acquisitions in the market for liquid gas, which is seen as a transition fuel in the global trudge to net zero carbon emissions Aside from building out an offering of low-carbon renewable diesel and expanding its network of electric vehicle charge points, the company has also been actively acquiring solar panel and heat pump installation businesses. Murphy told analysts on Tuesday it aims to become a \u201cpan-European leader in solar solutions\u201d for households and businesses. \u201cThe new strategy will simplify the business and allow it to focus its annual M&A [merger and acquisition] spending of \u00a3300 million to \u00a3400 million into the energy segment,\u201d according to Fitch, the credit ratings agency. DCC also plans to accelerate acquisitions in the market for liquid gas, which is seen as a transition fuel in the global trudge to net zero carbon emissions. He highlighted the US profane market, where DCC only has a 1.5 per cent market share, as an obvious target. All told, its so-called green transition services, renewables and other businesses accounted for 35 per cent of DCC Energy\u2019s earnings last year, up from 22 per cent two years earlier. A further 42 per cent came from liquid gas. Goodbody Stockbrokers said DCC is now firmly in the \u201ccleantech wheelhouse\u201d. But with analysts pencilling in an average price target of close to \u00a370 for the stock \u2014 about 30 per cent above where it is trading \u2014 Murphy still has some convincing to do.

Kennedy Jr. and a bad day for companies that make vaccines. As President-elect Trump announced that Kennedy will be his nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, stocks in top vaccine makers dropped sharply, wiping billions of dollars off the value of companies including Pfizer, the Wall Street Journal reports. Companies including BioNTech, Moderna, and Novavax began falling Thursday afternoon and dropped more in after-hours trading after Trump confirmed the pick. Stocks continued to fall Friday in the US and Europe, with Pfizer down more than 4% and Moderna down more than 7% by mid-morning.\r\n                                     \r\n                                        Kennedy has long voiced skepticism about vaccines and has promoted discredited theories about vaccines causing autism. Health experts fear that if he is confirmed as HHS secretary, his policies could deter Americans from receiving routine immunizations, CNBC reports. Last week, he said he's \"not going to take away anybody's vaccines,\" but wants to \"make sure scientific safety studies and efficacy are out there, and people can make individual assessments about whether that product is going to be good for them.\" Vaccine scientists, however, worry that he will put fellow vaccine critics on boards that oversee immunization advice, the Journal reports.\r\n                                     \r\n                                        \"He's a science denialist,\" Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease physician at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, tells the Journal. Offit says Kennedy has used his \"famous name\" as \"a platform to frighten parents unnecessarily about vaccine safety.\"   JP Morgan analysts said Friday they \"are not surprised the sector has been under pressure on the potential for RFK Jr. having oversight of the various agencies within HHS (including the FDA, the CDC, NIH, and Medicare\/Medicaid) given his previous stated views on the industry,\" Reuters reports. RBC analyst Brian Abrahams warned the appointment could also have \"far-reaching and difficult-to-project implications for the biotechnology sector, adding a considerable layer of uncertainty and challenging investability.\"   (More Robert F.

Despite recent market volatility and significant foreign outflows, the resilience of domestic retail investors in India is at its highest. In October 2024, mutual fund net inflows reached a remarkable \u20b92.40 lakh crore, pushing the industry\u2019s AUM to an all-time high of \u20b967.26 lakh crore. Equity-oriented schemes saw their highest monthly inflows, attracting \u20b941,887 crore, clearly demonstrating investor confidence in the equity market. This increase from September\u2019s inflows highlights a strong and unwavering commitment by retail investors, even in the face of market fluctuations. Notably, around 30%(\u20b912,278.78 crore) of these new flows were directed toward thematic funds, marking one of the highest allocations to these focused investments. This trend suggests that retail investors are now more willing than ever to take calculated risks, betting on specific sectors or investment themes for potential growth. This shift underscores a change in retail investor preferences, as they increasingly look beyond traditional broad-market funds. Investors are showing their highest levels of interest in exploring specific themes and sectors, embracing riskier opportunities for potentially higher returns\u201d -- Karthick Jonagadla, smallcase Manager and Founder of Quantace Research Profectus Capital Private Limited (PCPL), an NBFC backed by Actis, a global private equity firm, announced impressive performance during the half year ended 30th September 2024. PCPL\u2019s AUM stands at Rs 3,109 crores as of September 2024, up 15% from September 2023. The company is dedicated to funding micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) across eleven product clusters in India that need tailor-made financing for their growth aspirations. Q2FY25 key performance highlights: Total Income from operations for the half year stood at Rs 202 crores compared to Rs. 194 crores for the half year ended 30th September 2023. Net Profit Before Tax is up to Rs 21 crores. The AUM grew to Rs. 3109 crores as of 30th September 2024, reflecting a 15% growth over AUM as on 30th September 2023. The Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) and Net Non-Performing Assets (NNPA) ratios were maintained at 1.8% and 1.3% respectively on the total AUM, reflecting the high quality of the company\u2019s asset portfolio. Commenting on the results, Mr K V Srinivasan, Executive Director and CEO, Profectus Capital Private Limited, said \u201cOur Q2 results are part of the journey towards sustainable book quality and profitability. We aim to achieve optimal cost \u2013 income ratios and sustainable return on assets of about 3% over the next few years. Our strong focus on appropriate risk management and state of the art systems will play an important role in enhancing scale of our operations and achieving our objective of supporting growth of the MSME sector in India. Oct\u201924 saw the Indian equity markets (Nifty 50 index) correcting ~6% (closing 8% lower from its all-time high). India saw FII outflows of INR 1.1 tn (USD 13.5 bn) due to a weak earnings season, expensive Indian market and inflows into other markets. FII selling was however counter-balanced by INR 1.07 tn (USD 12.9 bn) of domestic inflows. A key driver of this, is the increasing retail participation in equity markets through SIP flows (up from INR 31 bn\/month in Apr\u201916 to INR 253 bn\/month in Oct\u201924) FII selling impact could have been sharper (but for DII support): Significant FII outflows have historically led to sharp corrections in the Indian markets. In most instances wherein the Nifty 50 has declined > 5% in a month, FII flows have been negative. Interestingly, despite the highest-ever monthly FII outflows (INR 1.1 tn) in Oct\u201924, Indian equity markets fell only 6%, remaining fairly resilient due to DIIs counter-balancing with INR 1.07 tn (USD 12.9 bn) of inflows. A key driver of this is the increasing retail participation in equity markets through SIP flows (up from INR 31 bn\/month in Apr\u201916 to INR 253 bn\/month in Oct\u201924). Weak earnings, >+1 SD valuations, other exciting opportunities drive FII outflows: Intense selling across FIIs can be attributed to: (1) A weak earnings season (Analysis of 157 companies out of the JMFL coverage of 275 suggest 44% (69 companies) missed Q2 estimates, 41% (65 companies) beat Q2 estimates while 15% (23 companies) were inline); (2) An overvalued Indian equity market (Nifty valuations through Jul\u201924 to Sep\u201924 suggest Nifty 1 year forward was >+1 standard deviation (21.6x) above mean; (3) Flow of foreign capital into other markets. (China, Japan and Taiwan have seen inflow of foreign capital) Indian sectoral flows for Oct\u201924: Sectors which saw the highest outflows included BFSI (-USD 3.11 bn), Oil & Gas (-USD 2.55 bn), FMCG (-USD 1.38 bn) and Autos (-USD 1.24 bn). Chemicals (+USD 70 mn) and Metals (+USD 17 mn) were the only sectors which witnessed inflows. 1 BRITANNIA Good numbers Volume growth at 8% as per estimates Margins decline to 15.5% vs expected 18.9% Revenue up 5% to Rs 4668 Cr PAT down 9% to Rs 532 Cr 2 ONGC Better than estimates QoQ Net Profit Up 34% Rs 11,984 Cr Vs 8,938 Cr Revenue Down 4% Rs 33,881 Cr Vs 35,266 Cr Margin At 50.3% Vs 48.1% 3 HINDALCO All round beat Net Profit up 123% Rs 1,891 Cr Vs 847 Cr Revenue Up 7.7% Rs 22,262 Cr Vs 20,676 Cr EBITDA Up 56.5% Rs 2,749 Cr Vs 1,756 Cr Margin at 12.4% Vs 8.5% 4 TRIVENI TURBINE Good Net Profit Up 41.7% Rs 91 Cr Vs 64 Cr Revenue Up 29.2% Rs 501 Cr Vs 388 Cr EBITDA Up 49.7% Rs 11.4 Cr Vs 74.4 Cr Margin At 22.2% Vs 19.2% 5 NMDC Ok but Below estimates Net Profit Up 18.1% Rs 1,211.6 Cr Vs 1,026 Cr Revenue Up 22.5% Rs 4,919 Cr Vs 4,014 Cr EBITDA up 16.4% 1,385.7 Cr Vs 1,191 Cr Margin At 28.2% Vs 29.7% (YoY) Bonus 2 for 1 6 AWFIS SPACE Good Net Profit Rs 38.6 Cr Vs -4.3 Cr Revenue Up 40.5% Rs 292.3 Cr Vs 208 Cr EBITDA Up 67.4% Rs 100 Cr Vs 59.8 Cr Margin At 34.3% Vs 28.8% 7 JUBILANT FOOD Inline Net Profit Down 27.9% Rs 52 Cr Vs 72.1 Cr Revenue Up 9.1% Rs 1,466.8 Cr Vs 1,344.8 Cr Margin At 19.4% Vs 21% 8 BANSAL WIRE Good Revenue: Rs 825 Cr vs 603 Cr PAT Rs 40 Cr vs 18 Cr 9 IOC\/BPCL\/HPCL\/ONGC Brent crude fell to $72 10 CELLO WORLD Started production at glassware mfg unit in Rajasthan * ABFRL * AARTIIND * GRANULES * HINDCOPPER * MANAPPURAM Orient Technologies Ltd. is a leading IT provider specializing in innovative cloud and data management solutions for enterprises sector in India, has announced its financial results for the second quarter & half year ended September 30th, 2024.

Indian markets underperformed compared to global peers, primarily due to aggressive Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) selling. FIIs offloaded roughly \u20b920,000 crore from Indian equities last week. In sectoral trends, IT stocks rallied post-U.S. election results, lifting the Nifty IT Index by 4%. Conversely, the high-beta Nifty Realty Index fell by 4%. With major global events and Q2 earnings behind us, the market focus now shifts to key macroeconomic data and the last round of Q2 earnings. India is set to release CPI and IIP data on November 12, with WPI data expected on November 14. Globally, the U.S. inflation report on November 13 will be critical, as it may influence the Federal Reserve\u2019s upcoming policy stance. Additionally, investors will monitor developments in China\u2019s economic stimulus package. The performance of U.S. bond yields and the Dollar Index will be pivotal for emerging markets like India, as both have surged since the U.S. election outcome. Given this backdrop, FII activity will remain a crucial driver for the Indian equity market in the near term. Despite the ongoing outrage of funds since last month, this month saw an unprecedented applications of about 40-50 new FPI registrations which are eyeing to enter the Indian market. All thanks to SEBI\u2019s recent relaxation to NRIs, permitting them to participate upto 100% and announcing measures for ease of entry and operations in India. Though FPI community had been very cautious about Indian markets in the last couple of months, shifting their allocation to other countries like China; India still stands on better footing as compared to other markets. The major factors attributable are political certainty, long term growth, better yields, substantial capex spending by the government and last but not the least, the central bank\u2019s vigilant approach while announcing rate cuts to put a check on inflation.  The offshore participants are optimistic that the RBI will adopt a balanced approach to ensure the cost of raising funds is under control and is made easily accessible to India Inc in the upcoming quarter\u2019s announcement. Additionally, the outcome of the recent election results held in the US has created an optimism for the Indian market considering the strategic partnership between the two countries. This will boost the economic and mutual businesses and other foreign trade policies which will make India more lucrative for foreign investments. We may see the upside in FPI\u2019s inflows in equity and debt segment turning in green in the coming few trading cycles. The market reflects distinct asset reactions under Trump\u2019s economic stance. Key takeaways: 1. Interest Rates & Inflation: Trump\u2019s policies, especially in a possible 2.0 phase, lean towards a low-interest-rate environment. This may drive negative real interest rates, impacting U.S. consumers. 2. USD Impact: The USD has historically risen with Trump but faded within months, indicating a correlation with Fed cycles. Lower rates may weaken USD, potentially channeling positive flows to emerging markets. 3. Commodities: Gold and oil have diverged; while oil responds to supply-demand shocks, gold could thrive in an inflationary, low-rate scenario, aligning with past trends under Trump. 4. Equity: US manufacturing shows strength from reindustrialization. Indian IT, too, benefits with increased U.S. budgets post-corporate tax cuts. 5. Global Trade: Trade deficits expanded, but dependence on China decreased. China may mirror Mexico\u2019s experience in Trump 1.0, potentially benefiting amidst trade realignments. Trump\u2019s influence touches on inflation, asset valuation, and sectoral shifts, with implications for global markets and emerging economies. C.E.

Stock index futures fell and the yuan weakened following the late afternoon announcement, while oil and iron ore prices also declined. The plan to defuse local government debt, long considered a time bomb in the Chinese financial system, came after a week-long meeting of the country\u2019s top legislators. Investors had hoped the high-level gathering would also roll out potent fiscal spending to counter the threat of tariffs under a second Donald Trump presidency. Economists at Standard Chartered and Macquarie project China\u2019s growth would suffer a hit of as much as two percentage points should Trump follow through on his campaign vow to raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 60%. Officials can expect continued pressure on them to step up support for the economy in the months ahead. \u2014Richard Frost What You Need to Know Today Companies are already moving production away from China on concern Trump will raise levies on imported goods. Shoe retailer Steven Madden aims to reduce goods manufactured in China by 40% within the next year, up from its prior target of a 10% reduction. Church & Dwight has already shifted some output from the country, such as its Waterpik oral-care business. \u201cThere are plans in place and actions that we\u2019ve taken to mitigate that impact,\u201d CFO Rick Dierker said last week in response to a question on tariffs. \u201cJust like everybody, we\u2019re well aware of implications there.\u201d\u00a0 Cartier owner Richemont is the latest European luxury brand to see a hit from China\u2019s downturn. The Swiss group reported a 12% drop in operating profit for the six months through September, with sales in China falling 27%. Chairman Johann Rupert said Chinese demand for pricey goods \u201cwill take longer to recover,\u201d and is particularly hitting its watch brands. Richemont joins companies including LVMH and Kering in feeling the pinch from more cautious shoppers in China as a multi-year luxury boom ends. Cartier owner Richemont posted a drop in sales in China. Photographer: Raul Ariano\/Bloomberg A plunge in the shares of Reliance Industries is underscoring investor concern that a slump in India\u2019s previously red-hot equities market will deepen. The company controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani has lost almost $50 billion of market capitalization as the most valuable Indian firm struggles with weakening earnings and an economic slowdown. Sentiment toward Indian stocks has turned negative in recent weeks, with the value of equity cash trading touching the lowest level on Wednesday in almost a year. The Biden administration is racing to complete Chips Act agreements with companies such as Intel and Samsung Electronics, aiming to shore up one of its signature initiatives before Trump enters the White House. While the Commerce Department has allocated more than 90% of the $39 billion in grants under the 2022 Chips and Science Act, a landmark law designed to rebuild the domestic chip industry, the agency has only announced one binding agreement so far. Announcements on a number of companies still in the process are said to be coming soon. - Bloomberg Turnover: (NSE + BSE) Cash Volume: 100043.17 + 6069.48 Total: 106112.65 F&O Volume: 455902.04 + 36083743.0 Total: 36539645.05 Provisional Cash FII\/FPI: NET SELL: -3404.04\u00a0 (9336.94 - 12740.98)\u00a0 DII: NET BUY: +1748.44\u00a0 (11246.96 - 9498.52) Contract has been awarded to HAL for Avionics Upgrade of Dornier-228 Transport Aircraft, for enhancing IAF\u2019s operational capability.

The stock has surged over 5 per cent last week and has closed on a strong note. This rise has taken the share price well above a key resistance level of \u20b92,900. The price action last week indicates that the stock has got strong buyers in the \u20b92,900-\u20b92,850 region. This zone will continue to act as a good support and limit the downside going forward. Mahindra & Mahindra share price can rise to \u20b93,200 in the coming weeks. \n\t\tComments\n\t\t BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

We failed to foresee competition from big players, heavy investment in the industry and the impact of the industry growing capacity way ahead of demand. This will take force start turf wars in every segment of the paint market. Even a champion like Asianpaints is now on a sticky wicket. The wet paint may end up drying a lot faster,\u201d he wrote on X. Asian Paints stock has hit 52-week low today at \u20b92,506 on the NSE post 43.71% decline in consolidated net profit to \u20b9693.66 crore for the September quarter. Asian Paints on Saturday reported a 43.71 per cent decline in consolidated net profit to \u20b9693.66 crore for the September quarter, impacted by soft-demand conditions, material price inflation and a decline in decorative and coatings business in the domestic market.The company had logged a net profit of \u20b91,232.39 crore during the July-September period a year ago, according to a regulatory filing by Asian Paints. Its revenue from operations was down 5.3 per cent to \u20b98,027.54 crore in the September quarter. In the year-ago period, it stood at \u20b98,478.57 crore.

For Netflix, it is their biggest live sports event to date, and an opportunity to make sure it can handle audience demand with the NFL and WWE on the horizon. The bout between the YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul, and Tyson, 58-year-old former heavyweight champion, from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, will stream globally and be available to Netflix's 280 million subscribers at no additional cost. Netflix will broadcast the bout in English, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, French and German. It was originally scheduled for July 20, but was delayed by Tyson having a medical episode on a plane and needing time to recover from a stomach ulcer. Netflix declined multiple requests by The Associated Press to make a company executive available to discuss expectations about the fight. JP Morgan Chase analyst Doug Anmuth has not wavered in his prediction that it will be the most-watched fight ever. That might be an unrealistic bar to climb since four of Muhammad Ali's bouts had estimated worldwide audiences of one billion. The modern-day U.S. mark of 4.6 million from the 2015 bout between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao could be attainable though. \u201cWe believe the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight could be the most watched boxing match ever given ease of access and NFLX\u2019s (Netflix's) large global subscriber base, and it should attract Ad Tier subs, viewers, and dollars,\" Anmuth said in his analyst note according to CNBC Pro. \"Netflix is increasingly focused on sports entertainment, events, and shoulder content, and we expect a bigger push into live sports over time, particularly as negotiating leverage shifts in NFLX\u2019s direction.\u201d Netflix has used live sports as support programming for documentaries and series it airs. \u201cCountdown: Paul vs. Tyson\u201d, a three-part documentary series previewing the fight card, was ranked second Thursday night among Netflix's most-viewed shows. Last November\u2019s Netflix Cup, where Formula 1 drivers were paired with PGA golfers in a match-play format, brought together famous figures from \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d and \u201cFull Swing,\u201d The March 3 Netflix Slam exhibition match between Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz tied in with \u201cPoint Break\" and a documentary series about Alcaraz that will air next year. The NFL elected to partner with Netflix for a Christmas Day doubleheader of games because two series \u2014 \u201cQuarterback\u201d and \u201cReceiver\u201d \u2014 were among Netflix\u2019s top 10 series globally. Most Valuable Promotions is handling the production of Friday's bout while CBS will produce the two NFL games for Netflix. When \u201cRaw\u201d begins airing on Netflix in January, World Wrestling Entertainment handles the production of all its events. Netflix will carry \u201cRaw\u201d in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Latin America beginning on Jan. 6, with additional countries to be added as contracts expire. The bigger component, though, is that Netflix will carry all of the company\u2019s shows overseas, including its premium live events like WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Royal Rumble. \u201cTechnically, it is a great dry run by putting on live events. The biggest problem they might have is you just end up in a situation where you\u2019ve got so much volume and viewing a way that you haven\u2019t had in the past,\u201d said Patrick Crakes, a media consultant and former Fox Sports executive. \u201cIt could end up being more than who watches the NFL games for a period of time. Others are handling the production, what they have to worry about is the operational flow. They know what they are doing.\u201d ___ AP sports: https:\/\/apnews.com\/sports Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Kennedy has faced widespread criticism for his baseless claims  that some vaccines are not safe and effective and that they\u2019re linked to autism. He has said that he will institute a purge at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and that he will remove fluoride from the public water supply and take measures to limit ultra-processed food.   Shares in both pharmaceuticals  and biotech fell \u2013 the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF fell over four percent during morning trading,  Reuters  noted.   Packaged food and beverage companies, such as Pepsi and Coca-Cola, also saw their shares take a downturn.   But the worst effect was seen among makers of vaccines, whose shares initially fell on Thursday and continued to do so on Friday. Moderna saw a seven percent dip just a day after seeing its lowest since April 2020. Meanwhile, Pfizer dropped almost four percent and Novavax was down two percent.   Analysts at the investment firm Jefferies Group wrote that \u201cThe point is around sentiment, stance and perspective \u2013 that impacts biotech investors\u2019 view of how FDA and other HHS issues will evolve (ie not accelerating drugs and pro-biotech).\u201d   Similarly, major operators in the European pharma market also saw the effects of Kennedy\u2019s nomination to the top health job in the largest drug market in the world.   In Germany, Pfizer\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine partner BioNtech dropped over 10 percent, set to be its largest one-day drop since August. Its stock in the US tumbled almost five percent. GSK saw their shares go down almost four percent and French drugmaker Sanofi lost 3.6 percent.   A large supplier of biotech lab gear and substances, Sartorious, saw their shares drop by 3.8 percent, while mpox vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic dropped 16 percent as it was also harmed by its results in the third quarter.   The CEO of the Danish firm shared worries that Kennedy\u2019s nomination could lead to an increase in vaccine skepticism. However, he also told Reuters  that the American response to the pandemic during Trump\u2019s first stint in the White House made him confident that there would be future bio-defense funding.   Analysts at JP Morgan Chase wrote: \u201cWe are not surprised the sector has been under pressure on the potential for RFK Jr. having oversight of the various agencies within HHS (including the FDA, the CDC, NIH, and Medicare\/Medicaid) given his previous stated views on the industry.\u201d   A number of medical scientists shared their concerns on Friday that vaccination efforts could suffer.   RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said Kennedy\u2019s nomination could have \u201cfar-reaching and difficult-to-project implications for the biotechnology sector, adding a considerable layer of uncertainty and challenging investability,\u201d according to Reuters  .   Meanwhile, shares in Novo Nordisk, the obesity drugmaker, saw its shares drop 4.3 percent while shares in Eli Lilly, the US drugmaker, dropped four percent.   Ozempic, the Novo Nordisk drug often prescribed for weight loss, has faced criticism from Kennedy, arguing that it put the focus on the symptoms of the obesity crisis instead of taking actions to create a better food system.   Kennedy has also argued for removing ultra-processed foods from school lunches to combat chronic diseases.   Several packaged food giants, such as Hershey, General Mills, Conagra Brands, and Kraft Heinz, all decreased more than three percent, while shares in Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage, and Keurig Dr Pepper dropped between one and four percent.

Kennedy has faced widespread criticism for his baseless claims  that some vaccines are not safe and effective and that they\u2019re linked to autism. He has said that he will institute a purge at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and that he will remove fluoride from the public water supply and take measures to limit ultra-processed food.   Shares in both pharmaceuticals  and biotech fell \u2013 the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF fell over four percent during morning trading,  Reuters  noted.   Packaged food and beverage companies, such as Pepsi and Coca-Cola, also saw their shares take a downturn.   But the worst effect was seen among makers of vaccines, whose shares initially fell on Thursday and continued to do so on Friday. Moderna saw a seven percent dip just a day after seeing its lowest since April 2020. Meanwhile, Pfizer dropped almost four percent and Novavax was down two percent.   Analysts at the investment firm Jefferies Group wrote that \u201cThe point is around sentiment, stance and perspective \u2013 that impacts biotech investors\u2019 view of how FDA and other HHS issues will evolve (ie not accelerating drugs and pro-biotech).\u201d   Similarly, major operators in the European pharma market also saw the effects of Kennedy\u2019s nomination to the top health job in the largest drug market in the world.   In Germany, Pfizer\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine partner BioNtech dropped over 10 percent, set to be its largest one-day drop since August. Its stock in the US tumbled almost five percent. GSK saw their shares go down almost four percent and French drugmaker Sanofi lost 3.6 percent.   A large supplier of biotech lab gear and substances, Sartorious, saw their shares drop by 3.8 percent, while mpox vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic dropped 16 percent as it was also harmed by its results in the third quarter.   The CEO of the Danish firm shared worries that Kennedy\u2019s nomination could lead to an increase in vaccine skepticism. However, he also told Reuters  that the American response to the pandemic during Trump\u2019s first stint in the White House made him confident that there would be future bio-defense funding.   Analysts at JP Morgan Chase wrote: \u201cWe are not surprised the sector has been under pressure on the potential for RFK Jr. having oversight of the various agencies within HHS (including the FDA, the CDC, NIH, and Medicare\/Medicaid) given his previous stated views on the industry.\u201d   A number of medical scientists shared their concerns on Friday that vaccination efforts could suffer.   RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said Kennedy\u2019s nomination could have \u201cfar-reaching and difficult-to-project implications for the biotechnology sector, adding a considerable layer of uncertainty and challenging investability,\u201d according to Reuters  .   Meanwhile, shares in Novo Nordisk, the obesity drugmaker, saw its shares drop 4.3 percent while shares in Eli Lilly, the US drugmaker, dropped four percent.   Ozempic, the Novo Nordisk drug often prescribed for weight loss, has faced criticism from Kennedy, arguing that it put the focus on the symptoms of the obesity crisis instead of taking actions to create a better food system.   Kennedy has also argued for removing ultra-processed foods from school lunches to combat chronic diseases.   Several packaged food giants, such as Hershey, General Mills, Conagra Brands, and Kraft Heinz, all decreased more than three percent, while shares in Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage, and Keurig Dr Pepper dropped between one and four percent.

Kennedy has faced widespread criticism for his baseless claims  that some vaccines are not safe and effective and that they\u2019re linked to autism. He has said that he will institute a purge at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and that he will remove fluoride from the public water supply and take measures to limit ultra-processed food.   Shares in both pharmaceuticals  and biotech fell \u2013 the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF fell over four percent during morning trading,  Reuters  noted.   Packaged food and beverage companies, such as Pepsi and Coca-Cola, also saw their shares take a downturn.   But the worst effect was seen among makers of vaccines, whose shares initially fell on Thursday and continued to do so on Friday. Moderna saw a seven percent dip just a day after seeing its lowest since April 2020. Meanwhile, Pfizer dropped almost four percent and Novavax was down two percent.   Analysts at the investment firm Jefferies Group wrote that \u201cThe point is around sentiment, stance and perspective \u2013 that impacts biotech investors\u2019 view of how FDA and other HHS issues will evolve (ie not accelerating drugs and pro-biotech).\u201d   Similarly, major operators in the European pharma market also saw the effects of Kennedy\u2019s nomination to the top health job in the largest drug market in the world.   In Germany, Pfizer\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine partner BioNtech dropped over 10 percent, set to be its largest one-day drop since August. Its stock in the US tumbled almost five percent. GSK saw their shares go down almost four percent and French drugmaker Sanofi lost 3.6 percent.   A large supplier of biotech lab gear and substances, Sartorious, saw their shares drop by 3.8 percent, while mpox vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic dropped 16 percent as it was also harmed by its results in the third quarter.   The CEO of the Danish firm shared worries that Kennedy\u2019s nomination could lead to an increase in vaccine skepticism. However, he also told Reuters  that the American response to the pandemic during Trump\u2019s first stint in the White House made him confident that there would be future bio-defense funding.   Analysts at JP Morgan Chase wrote: \u201cWe are not surprised the sector has been under pressure on the potential for RFK Jr. having oversight of the various agencies within HHS (including the FDA, the CDC, NIH, and Medicare\/Medicaid) given his previous stated views on the industry.\u201d   A number of medical scientists shared their concerns on Friday that vaccination efforts could suffer.   RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said Kennedy\u2019s nomination could have \u201cfar-reaching and difficult-to-project implications for the biotechnology sector, adding a considerable layer of uncertainty and challenging investability,\u201d according to Reuters  .   Meanwhile, shares in Novo Nordisk, the obesity drugmaker, saw its shares drop 4.3 percent while shares in Eli Lilly, the US drugmaker, dropped four percent.   Ozempic, the Novo Nordisk drug often prescribed for weight loss, has faced criticism from Kennedy, arguing that it put the focus on the symptoms of the obesity crisis instead of taking actions to create a better food system.   Kennedy has also argued for removing ultra-processed foods from school lunches to combat chronic diseases.   Several packaged food giants, such as Hershey, General Mills, Conagra Brands, and Kraft Heinz, all decreased more than three percent, while shares in Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage, and Keurig Dr Pepper dropped between one and four percent.

Alphaviruses have a broad host range, and can cause diverse disease outcomes like arthritis, and encephalitis. The host ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) plays critical roles in regulating cellular processes to control the infections with various viruses, including alphaviruses. Previous studies suggest alphaviruses hijack UPS for virus infection, but the molecular mechanisms remain poorly characterized. In addition, whether certain E3 ubiquitin ligases or deubiquitinases act as alphavirus restriction factors remains poorly understood. Here, we employed a cDNA expression screen to identify E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM32 as a novel intrinsic restriction factor against alphavirus infection, including VEEV-TC83, SINV, and ONNV. Ectopic expression of TRIM32 reduces alphavirus infection, whereas depletion of TRIM32 with CRISPR-Cas9 increases infection. We demonstrate that TRIM32 inhibits alphaviruses through a mechanism that is independent of the TRIM32-STING-IFN axis. Combining reverse genetics and biochemical assays, we found that TRIM32 interferes with genome translation after membrane fusion, prior to replication of the incoming viral genome. Furthermore, our data indicate that the monoubiquitination of TRIM32 is important for its antiviral activity. Notably, we also show two TRIM32 pathogenic mutants R394H and D487N, related to Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), have a loss of antiviral activity against VEEV-TC83. Collectively, these results reveal that TRIM32 acts as a novel intrinsic restriction factor suppressing alphavirus infection and provides insights into the interaction between alphaviruses and the host UPS. Due to climate change, wildlife habitat loss, and human activities, alphavirus infections are a growing threat to public health. The host UPS has critical role in virus-host interaction, but how the UPS impact alphavirus infection is not completely understood. We hypothesize that there are certain host E3 ubiquitin ligases that modulate the replication of alphaviruses. These ligases target either viral proteins or cellular proteins that are required for viral replication. In this study, we found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM32 inhibits diverse alphaviruses (including VEEV, SINV, and ONNV) in multiple cell types. Mechanistically, TRIM32 impairs primary translation of incoming viral genome. Additionally, we also found that Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy associated TRIM32 mutants R394H and D487N have a loss-of-function with respect to viral inhibition. These findings suggest that TRIM32-mediated inhibition of alphaviruses in a manner that depends on its monoubiquitination.

Competing interests:  The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Alphaviruses are mosquito transmitted positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that have a broad host range, including human, horses, birds, and rodents [1]. Based on the genetic relatedness and disease manifestation, alphaviruses are classified into two groups, arthritogenic alphaviruses and encephalitic alphaviruses. The former include chikungunya virus (CHIKV), O\u2019ynong-nyong virus (ONNV), Ross river virus (RRV), and Mayaro virus (MAYV), and the latter include Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), eastern and western equine encephalitis virus (EEEV, WEEV) [2,3]. To date, there is no approved vaccine or specific antiviral agent for treating encephalitic alphavirus infection. Due to climate change, human activities, and habitat loss of wild animals, alphavirus infections have been identified globally and pose potential threats to humans worldwide [4,5]. Accordingly, understand how these viruses interact with their hosts at the molecular level is an important area of research. Host factors play important role in governing virus infection. Identification and characterization of these factors offers valuable insight into viral pathogenesis and potential strategies to develop of antiviral therapeutics. Genetic screens have been used to identify numerous host factors that are important for alphavirus infection. These include cellular receptors for alphavirus entry, such as MXRA8 for CHIKV and ONNV [6], LDLRAD3 for VEEV [7], and VLDLR and ApoER2 for Semliki forest virus (SFV) [8]. Host factors that are required for alphavirus replication have also been identified, including G3BP1\/2, FXR1\/2, FMR [9], SEC61A, VCP [10], and FHL1 [11]. Several interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) products, including ZAP, IFIT1, IFIT3, ISG20, viperin, and several poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases, have been implicated as anti-alphavirus restriction factors. [12\u201316]. In addition to ISGs, basally expressed proteins such as DDX56 [17] and DDX39A [18] have been identified as restriction factors that inhibit alphaviruses. Previous studies found that the host ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) plays a crucial role in alphaviruses infection. Specifically, the post-entry stages of alphaviruses can be disrupted by UPS inhibitors, such as proteasome inhibitors and deubiquitinating enzyme inhibitors [19\u201321]. To date, only a few E3 ubiquitin ligases (E3) and deubiquitinases (DUB) have been identified as host factor or restriction factor for alphaviruses. TRIM25, a well-studied E3 that participates in host antiviral innate immunity [22], also acts as a co-factor of zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) to promote ZAP-mediated inhibition of alphaviruses [23\u201325]. In mosquito cells, an E3 ubiquitin ligase scaffolding protein, AcCullin3 was identified as pro-viral factor of CHIKV replication [26]. The membrane associated ring-CH-type finger 8 (MARCH8) is a broad-spectrum antiviral E3, which can also restrict alphavirus infection by targeting viral envelope protein E2 for degradation [27,28]. In this study, we used a cDNA expression strategy to screen 118 human E3 ligases for antiviral effects on VEEV-TC83-GFP infection. TRIM32 was identified as a novel restriction factor that inhibits multiple alphaviruses including VEEV-TC83, SINV, and ONNV. TRIM32 is a RING type E3 ubiquitin ligase [29] that has reported roles in influenza A virus infection, tumorigenesis, and microRNA processing [29\u201333]. TRIM32 is also reported to be involved in regulation of the host antiviral immune response. TRIM32-mediates the K63-linked ubiquitination of MITA\/STING to promote STING-mediated interferon production and cellular antiviral responses [34]. TRIM32 also targets TRIF for TAX1BP1-mediated selective autophagic degradation to suppress TLR3\/4-mediated immune responses [35]. TRIM32 can also directly regulate virus infection. It has been reported that TRIM32 regulates the biological activity of the HIV-1 Tat protein [36] and directly targets PB1 protein of Influenza A virus (IAV) for proteasome degradation to restrict viral replication [37]. To dissect the underlying mechanisms of TRIM32-mediated inhibition of alphavirus, we used VEEV-TC83 as a model. By combining reverse genetic and biochemical assays, we show that TRIM32 limits the translation of incoming viral genome. Proximity-labeling proteomic approaches and intracellular co-localization analysis suggest TRIM32 associates with endosome-lysosome compartments, where alphaviruses undergo membrane fusion and uncoating to initiate cytosolic entry [38]. Furthermore, we found that two pathogenic mutants of TRIM32 associated with Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2H (LGMD2H), R394H and D487N, lack antiviral activity against VEEV-TC83. Together, our findings highlight TRIM32 as cell intrinsic restriction factor that inhibits alphavirus infection. To identify E3 ubiquitin ligases that modulate alphavirus infection, we screened 118 human RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligases for effects on VEEV-TC83-GFP in HeLa cells using methods described in our previous study [39]. Briefly, HeLa cells were transduced with E3-expressing lentiviruses and were then infected with VEEV-TC83-GFP at MOI of 0.1 for 24 hours (hrs), after which virus infectivity was quantified by flow cytometry. We found that VEEV-TC83-GFP infectivity was strikingly reduced in TRIM32 expressing cells, and enhanced by TRIM33 (Fig 1A). Next, we established HeLa stable cells expressing TRIM8, TRIM25, TRIM26, TRIM32, and TRIM33 to evaluate their effects on VEEV-TC83-GFP infection. Again, TRIM32 showed antiviral activity, while TRIM33 showed pro-viral activity towards VEEV-TC83-GFP (Fig 1B). The other three TRIM proteins did not influence VEEV infection, even though they are reported to positively regulate host antiviral responses [40]. We further investigated the effects of TRIM32 on other RNA viruses, coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), Zika virus (ZIKV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). In contrast to VEEV, these viruses were not restricted by TRIM32 expression (S1A Fig). Based on these screening results, we chose TRIM32 for additional mechanistic studies. A. HeLa cells transduced with lentivirus co-expressing RFP and 118 different human RING type E3 ubiquitin ligases were infected with VEEV-TC83-GFP.

The cell culture supernatants were collected after multiple viral life cycles, and the production of progeny virions was determined by plaque assay. Both VEEV-TC83 and SINV production significantly decreased in TRIM32-expressing cells compared to control cells (Fig 1C and 1D). Because rodent animals play a role in alphavirus transmission, we speculated that mouse Trim32 may also influence alphavirus infection. Indeed, we found that Trim32 expression restricted VEEV-TC83-GFP infection significantly (Fig 1E). To complement the ectopic expression effects of TRIM32, we used CRISPR-Cas9 editing to silence Trim32 in C2C12 cells, which highly express Trim32. We observed a modest rescue of infection in the Trim32-depleted cells, suggesting that endogenous TRIM32 may contribute to cell intrinsic suppression of VEEV (Fig 1F). Together, these data demonstrate that TRIM32 from multiple species may function as an alphavirus restriction factor. Previous studies have reported that TRIM32 is a positive regulator of STING-mediated interferon production and cellular innate immune responses [34]. Therefore, we sought to determine if TRIM32 inhibits alphaviruses through regulation of STING or by other mechanisms. We used CRISPR-Cas9 editing to silence STING in HeLa cells and then test the effects of TRIM32 on alphavirus infection in the absence of STING [41]. Notably, TRIM32 retained anti-VEEV activity even when STING was depleted in HeLa cells (Fig 2A). Similar results were observed for U2OS cells (S1B Fig). Previous study reported that Huh7 cells lack detectable levels of STING [41]. Consistent with previous report, STING could barely be detected from our Huh7 cell lysates (Fig 2B). Therefore, we examined the effects of TRIM32 on VEEV infection in Huh7. As shown in Fig 2C, the infectivity of VEEV-TC83-GFP was significantly restricted in Huh7-TRIM32-3xF cells compared to Fluc-expressing cells. In addition, we deleted TBK1, a kinase that phosphorylates multiple regulators in of antiviral immunity [42], in TRIM32 expressing cells. Again, VEEV-TC83-GFP infection was strikingly reduced by TRIM32 expression in the absence of TBK1 (Fig 2D). Finally, silencing of two key transcriptional regulators of the interferon signaling pathway, STAT1 and IRF9, also did not abolish TRIM32-mediated inhibition of VEEV-TC83-GFP, but did abrogate interferon-mediated inhibition of the virus (Fig 2E and 2F). Collectively, our findings demonstrate that TRIM32 inhibits alphavirus independently of canonical of interferon-mediated antiviral pathways. A.

We transfected VEEV-TC83-GFP infectious viral RNA into HeLa-TRIM32 and HeLa-Fluc cells to measure virus production when entry is bypassed. The progeny virions in supernatants were collected at multiple time points up to 12 hrs and reinfected on to na\u00efve Huh7 cells. Infectivity of the newly produced viruses was then quantified by flow cytometry. By this method, no difference was observed between HeLa-TRIM32 and HeLa-Fluc cells (Fig 3A). Similar results were obtained by transfection of non-reporter VEEV-TC83 viral RNA, followed by quantification of viral yield by plaque assay (Fig 3B). At a later time point of 18 hrs, the viral yield was reduced in HeLa-TRIM32 cells relative to control cells (Fig 3C). These data indicate that TRIM32 has no effect on post-entry stages of VEEV-TC83 infection when viral replication is launched from transfected RNA. A.

VEEV-TC83 replicon RNA expressing Renilla luciferase was transfected into HeLa-TRIM32 or HeLa-Fluc cells, and cells were collected at multiple time points post-transfection to measure Renilla luciferase activity. The results demonstrate that the VEEV-TC83 replicon produced similar levels of Renilla luciferase in both TRIM32 and Fluc expressing cells, suggesting TRIM32 does not influence translation of transfected viral genomes and subsequent replication (Fig 3D). Similar results were observed in Huh7 cells (Fig 3E). Together, these data suggest TRIM32 does not impair the post-entry steps of VEEV infection. We next sought to investigate effects of TRIM32 on the early stages of VEEV infection. Starting with a binding and entry assay, we did not observe statistically significant changes in viral binding or entry of VEEV-TC83 when comparing HeLa cells expressing TRIM32 and Fluc (Fig 4A). However, a modest decrease (< 2-fold) of viral binding was observed in HeLa-TRIM32 cells. To verify this observation with an assay that might offer more sensitivity, we established a VEEV that contains a Nano-luciferase (NLuc) fusion at the N-terminus of capsid, hereafter termed VEEV-NLuc\/Cap, as a tool to study VEEV binding (S2A Fig). Because the NLuc is a part of the VEEV-NLuc\/Cap virion (S2B Fig), we can evaluate virus binding efficiency by measuring NLuc activity. To ensure this modification has no influence on receptor usage of LDLRAD3, we established HeLa-sgLDLRAD3 cells by using a human LDLRAD3 specific sgRNA for CRISPR-mediated gene silencing [7], followed by virus infectivity determination. As shown in S2C and S2D Fig, both VEEV-GFP and VEEV-NLuc\/Cap infection was reduced on HeLa-sgLDLRAD3 cells, but not ONNV and SINV. Finally, our data showed that there is no significant difference in NLuc activity after cold-binding of VEEV-NLuc\/Cap to TRIM32 and Fluc expressing cells (Fig 4B and 4C). A.

Briefly, HeLa-TRIM32 or HeLa-Fluc cells were infected with VEEV-TC83-GFP at MOI of 10 at 4\u00b0C for 1.5h. The unbound virions were washed using cold PBS, then the cells were incubated in PBS at pH7.4 or pH5.5 at 4\u00b0C for 10 minutes, with the more acidic pH promoting to viral membrane fusion on the plasma membrane. After neutral or acidic PBS treatment, PBS was replaced with pre-warmed medium containing 10nM bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) to block endosomal escape and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 12h. Viral infectivity was then quantified by using flow cytometry. We found that VEEV-TC83-GFP displayed similar infectivity under acidic conditions that bypass endosome-lysosome mediated membrane fusion in HeLa-TRIM32 and HeLa-Fluc cells (Fig 4E). Together, these findings suggest that TRIM32 does not obviously affect VEEV early steps of viral binding, but certain events in endosome-lysosome mediated membrane fusion is dampened. To further investigate the potential mechanisms of TRIM32-mediated VEEV inhibition, we attempted to identify viral and cellular proteins that interact with TRIM32 during viral infection. To do so, we applied a TurboID-mediated proximity labeling proteomics approach (Fig 5A) [44]. We first established HeLa stable cells expressing TRIM32-TurboID-HA or TurboID-HA and confirmed HeLa-TRIM32-TurboID-HA still exhibits inhibition of VEEV-TC83 (Fig 5B). Next, the cells were mock-infected or infected with VEEV-TC83-GFP at MOI of 25 in the presence of 500\u03bcM biotin for 6 hrs. Proximity labeling proteomic analysis was then performed as described previously [44]. After pulldown of candidate proteins with streptavidin beads and proteomic analysis, both TurboID-HA and TRIM32-TurboID-HA were shown to successfully target certain proteins for biotinylation (S3A Fig). Compared to TurboID-HA, there were 297 cellular proteins enriched in TRIM32-TurboID-HA samples, and 38 cellular proteins shared in TRIM32-TurboID-HA groups that were mock-infected or infected with VEEV-TC83 (S3B Fig). As shown in Fig 5C, compared to TurboID-HA, TRIM32 was highly enriched by TRIM32-TurboID-HA, which would be because of the self-interaction of TRIM32. However, there is no difference in the enrichment of viral proteins between TRIM32-TurboID-HA and TurboID-HA. This result suggests that TRIM32 and viral components are not close in proximity. Indeed, as shown in S3E and S3F Fig, we failed to observe the interaction between TRIM32 and viral capsid by using the co-immunoprecipitation assay. A.

Statistical significance was determined by unpaired students\u2019 t-test for A and C (****P<0.0001). \n              https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.ppat.1012312.g005 We analyzed the functions of the cellular proteins enriched by TRIM32 by using PANTHER [45], and found groups of proteins associated with endosomes or the endosome membrane, which are relevant to VEEV infection (S3C Fig). Those proteins included RAB5B, WDR81, and PIK3C3, which are known endosomal proteins (S3D Fig). To validate TRIM32 associates with endosome, we used co-localization analysis by microscopy. Our confocal images show that overexpressed TRIM32-mNeoGreen co-localizes with Rab7-mCherry, and TRIM32-mCherry (Fig 5D) co-localizes to endogenous LAMP1 (Fig 5E). These findings lead us to speculate that TRIM32 resides in the endosome and may impair cytosolic entry of VEEV after endosomal membrane fusion prior to genome translation. To test this model, we investigated the fate of incoming VEEV nucleocapsids using VEEV-NLuc\/Cap (Fig 6A and 6B). We found that the incoming NLuc\/Cap signal rapidly decreases starting at 30 minutes post entry, suggesting that nucleocapsids may undergo degradation or structure disruption in the presence of TRIM32 (Fig 6C). A similar phenomenon has been demonstrated during Dengue virus [46] and Yellow fever virus [47] infection, with degradation of incoming capsids being important for initiation of viral genome translation. Next, the stability of the NLuc\/Cap of VEEV was determined in HeLa-TRIM32 or HeLa-Fluc cells by VEEV-NLuc\/Cap infection in the presence or absence of cycloheximide. We found that NLuc\/Cap is less stable in TRIM32 expressing cells compared to HeLa-Fluc cells (Fig 6D and 6E). Our replicon assay showed that TRIM32 does not affect transfected viral RNA-mediated translation and replication (Fig 3C and 3D). Thus, we hypothesized that TRIM32 may destabilize the incoming nucleocapsids resulting in inhibition of primary genome translation. To verify this hypothesis, we engineered a reporter VEEV that has an NLuc fusion at the C-terminus of nonstructural protein 3, hereafter termed VEEV-nsP3\/NLuc (S4 Fig). As shown in S4 Fig, HeLa-TRIM32 and HeLa-Fluc cells were infected with VEEV-nsP3\/NLuc at MOI of 1, and cells were collected at multiple time points corresponding to steps of initial viral infection. Compared to HeLa-Fluc, the initial translation of VEEV-nsP3\/NLuc, as indicated by NLuc activity, is significantly lower in HeLa-TRIM32 cells (Fig 6F). To focus on the effects of TRIM32 on viral translation, ML336, a VEEV nsP2 specific inhibitor [48] was added to block viral genome replication-mediated amplification of NLuc signal. Again, the NLuc activity was lower in HeLa-TRIM32 cells during at all time points tested (Fig 6G). Together, by using sensitive viral tools, our data demonstrate that TRIM32 impairs a late entry step in a manner that leads to impaired translation of encapsidated viral RNA. A.

However, whether these pathogenic mutations influence the antiviral activity of TRIM32 has not been demonstrated. Here, we established HeLa stable cells expressing four TRIM32 mutants, including C39\/44A that inactivates E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, P130S, which is associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS11), and two well-characterized mutants R394H and D487N that are associated with Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (Fig 7A). Cells expressing TRIM32 mutants were infected with VEEV-TC83-GFP, and virus infectivity was quantified by flow cytometry. We found that the P130S mutant retains antiviral activity against VEEV, but C39\/44A, R394H, and D487N failed to inhibit VEEV infection (Fig 7B). Western blot analysis showed the expression of wild type and mutated TRIM32 proteins were not identical, as cells expressing wild-type or P130S TRIM32, but not C39\/44A, R394H, or D487N possess a higher molecular weight band (Fig 7B). This higher molecular weight band has been characterized as monoubiquitinated TRIM32 [50], suggesting that loss of TRIM32 antiviral function correlates with a loss of TRIM32 monoubiquitination. Next, we tested whether the intracellular distributions of C39\/44A, R394H, and D487N were altered compared to wild-type TRIM32. Indeed, the confocal images show that P130S behaved like the wild type TRIM32, which both form cytoplasmic bodies of similar size. However, C39\/44A mutant TRIM32 appeared to form massive aggregates, while both R394H and D487N failed to form cytoplasmic bodies and showed diffuse cytoplasmic distribution (Fig 7C). A.

Moreover, E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM32 is required for inhibition of VEEV. In this study, we screened a library of E3 ligases and identified TRIM32 as a restriction factor against alphaviruses, including VEEV, SINV, and ONNV (Figs 1 and S1). We also show that TRIM33 expression, a negative regulator of host innate immune response [51,52], significantly promoted VEEV-TC83 infection (Fig 1A and 1B). TRIM33 can also act as direct restriction factor that suppresses HIV-1 replication by targeting the viral integrase for proteasomal degradation [53]. Thus, the potential mechanism of TRIM33-mediated enhancement of VEEV warrants further study. TRIM32 belongs to C-VII subclass membrane of the TRIM protein family, which contains six NHL (NCL-1, HT2A, LIN-41) repeats in its C-terminus [54]. Human TRIM32 is expressed in many tissues, including skeletal muscle, brain, and heart [29]. As a E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIM32 plays important roles in several cellular process, including differentiation, tumor suppression, regeneration, microRNA process, muscle physiology, and antiviral innate immunity [30,34,35,37]. TRIM32 can also positively regulate host antiviral innate immunity by targeting STING for K63-linked ubiquitination [34], which results in a broad-spectrum of antiviral effects. In addition, TRIM32 can also be an intrinsic restriction factor. During IAV infection, basally expressed TRIM32 targets PB1 for proteasomal degradation, which inhibits infection prior to interferon-mediated effects [37]. In this study, we expand the role of TRIM32 as a restriction factor by demonstrating that it inhibits alphaviruses independently of its known role in regulating STING-IFN pathways (Figs 1 and 2). Mechanistically, we found that TRIM32 does not affect the viral binding, internalization of virions, or membrane fusion (Fig 4). Our data also suggest TRIM32 does not inhibit primary translation of viral genome replication. These conclusions were reached with several tools. Using the replication inhibitor ML366, we found that ML366 exerted no effects on VEEV-nsp3\/NLuc during the first 120 minutes of infection, whereas TRIM32 suppressed nsp3\/NLuc activity at the earliest time point of 30 minutes (Fig 6G). ML366 began suppressing nsp3\/NLuc after 120 minutes, indicating that replication begins around this time. TRIM32 did not suppress this early replication phase burst in nsp3\/NLuc activity, suggesting that viral genome amplification from the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was likely not affected. Additional support for a lack of effect on replication come from entry bypass experiments, in which TRIM32 did not suppress replication of transfected full length viral RNAs or replicons (Fig 3A and 3B). We additionally infer from our data that TRIM32 does not directly suppress primary translation of incoming RNAs. The VEEV-Rluc replicon activity was monitored from 1h to 6h, and TRIM32 had no effect at any time point, including 1 hour (h), suggesting that translation of the incoming RNA is unaffected (Fig 3C and 3D). We note limitations of this interpretation below. Our studies suggest TRIM32 inhibits a late entry step, likely after membrane fusion but prior to translation of viral RNA. We speculate TRIM32 may affect late entry processes related to uncoating based on studies with a new viral tool, VEEV-NLuc\/Cap, which has NLuc fused to capsid in the virion (S2 Fig). TRIM32 expression resulted in decreased NLuc\/Cap reporter activity at very early time points (30 min) after cold binding the virus and allowing internalization with a temperature shift (Fig 6D). This effect also occurred in the presence of cycloheximide, indicating that protein synthesis is not needed for TRIM32-dependent inhibition. Taken together, these replication cycle studies point to a TRIM32-mediated inhibition of VEEV at a late step in the viral entry pathway. This conclusion is consistent with proximity labeling proteomics and microscopy studies indicating that TRIM32 resides in endosomes (Fig 5), which are important for cytosolic entry of VEEV [38]. We additionally examined TRIM32 mutations associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS11) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) affect anti-alphavirus activity [29,32]. We found that P130S behaves similar to wild type TRIM32 with respect to viral inhibition and monoubiquitination, but R394H and D487N lost antiviral activity against VEEV-TC83 and did not express the larger second band, suggesting loss of monoubiquitination (Fig 7B). These defects also correlated with altered intracellular distributions (Fig 7C). We also show that E3 ligase activity is required for TRIM32-mediated inhibition of VEEV. However, we could not assess whether UPS inhibitors can subvert TRIM32-mediated inhibition of VEEV, because the host UPS also required for virus infection [19,21]. Previous study reported that TRIM32 mutants R394H and D487N lost monoubiquitination feature, but still remain the ability to self-associate. We also show that the monoubiquitination of TRIM32 is likely critical for its antiviral activity, as mutants lacking monoubiquitination also lack anti-VEEV function. Summarily, our findings implicate TRIM32 as novel host factor that inhibits alphaviruses. Our data suggest that TRIM32 inhibits a late step in viral entry, possibly related to capsid uncoating. However, our study has several limitations that, if addressed in future studies, would help further refine the biological relevance of TRIM32 during alphavirus infection and the current mechanistic model. 1) Additional TRIM32 gene silencing studies in primary cells will help confirm our studies in immortalized cells that TRIM32 functions as a cell intrinsic restriction factor. 2) TRIM32 does not appear to be an ISG [55], emphasizing the need for additional studies to understand how TRIM32 expression is regulated. 3) Our mechanistic studies did not include assays to directly investigate endosomal fusion, and R18-labeled virus could assist in further narrowing the proposed late entry mechanism. 4) While mutagenesis indicates that the E3 ligase activity of TRIM32 is important for its effects on VEEV, additional studies are needed to identify whether a viral or host factor is ubiquitinated by TRIM32, and what the consequence of this modification is. 5) The association of TRIM32 mutations with certain human diseases raises the question of whether individuals bearing these SNPs in TRIM32 are at higher risk for alphavirus infection. Additional studies in human populations or genetically defined animal models could help address this question. 293T, HeLa, Huh7.5, U2OS, C2C12, and BHK-21 cells were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 1% Penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco), and 1\u00d7 non-essential amino acids (NEAA; Gibco). All these cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. The viruses that used in this study were propagated as previously described: VEEV-GFP [56], ONNV-GFP, SINV-GFP, and CVB3-GFP [41]. ZIKV-GFP [57]. Lentiviral-based expression vector pTRIP.CMV.IVSb.ires.TagRFP-DEST [56], pSCRBBL-DEST, or pSCRPSY-DEST [58] were used for expression of genes of interest and generated using Gateway cloning. To generate TRIM32\/mCherry or TRIM32mNeoGreen expressing constructs, overlapping PCR was performed to fuse mCherry or mNeonGreen to the C-terminus of TRIM32. TRIM32 C39\/44A, P130S, R394H, and D487N mutants were generated by overlapping PCR. CRISPR\u2013Cas9 cloning and knockout bulk cells were prepared as previously described. Oligos encoding sgRNAs for generating knockout cells using CRISPR\u2013Cas9 were cloned into the lentiCRISPRv2 plasmid (a gift from F. Zhang, Addgene plasmid 52961) as previously described [59]. LentiCRISPRv2 clones containing guide sequences were sequenced, purified, and used for lentiviral production as described above. For generating bulk knockout cells, HeLa or C2C12 cells were transduced with the lentiCRISPRv2-derived lentivirus for 48 h, then reseeded into complete DMEM containing 4 \u03bcg\/ml puromycin for 3 days of selection to kill untransduced cells. Lentiviral production and transduction was performed as previous described [56]. Briefly, 8\u2009\u00d7\u2009105 293T cells in 6-well plates or 3 \u00d7\u2009105 cells in 24-well plates were co-transfected with plasmids expressing E3 (pTRIP-E3 or pSCRPSY-E3) [39], HIV-1 gag\u2013pol and VSV-G in a ratio of 1\/0.8\/0.2, respectively. For 6-well plate transfection, 6\u2009\u03bcl X-tremeGENE HP (Roche) was combined with 2.0\u2009\u03bcg total DNA in 100\u2009\u03bcl Opti-MEM (Gibco). For 24-well plate transfection, 1.5\u2009\u03bcl FuGENE (Roche) was combined with 0.5\u2009\u03bcg total DNA in 25\u2009\u03bcl Opti-MEM. Transfections were carried out for 6\u2009h, followed by a medium change to DMEM containing 3% FBS. Supernatants were collected at 48\u2009h and 72\u2009h, pooled, cleared by centrifugation and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. For lentiviral transduction, HeLa cells were seeded in to 24-well plates at a density of 2 \u00d7\u2009104 cells per well and transduced with lentivirus in transduction medium that containing 3% FBS, 20 mM HEPES, and 4 \u03bcg\/mL polybrene. HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 2x104 cells per well in 24-well plates and cells were then transduced with E3 lentiviruses in transduction medium. Cells were split and replated into 24-well plate at a ratio of 1:4 at 48 h post-transduction. 16\u201324 h later, the cells were infected with the VEEV-TC83-GFP at 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI. 1 MOI = 1 plaque formation unit per cell). The cells were harvested at 24 h post-infection for FACS-based infectivity analysis as previous study described [56]. VEEV-TC83 viral RNA and replicon RNA were in vitro transcribed using mMessage mMachine SP6 Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher, Cat#AM1340). RNA was purified from the transcription reaction using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Cat#74106) and quantified by Nanodrop. Transfection of viral infectious RNA and replicon RNA was performed with the TransIT-mRNA Transfection Kit (Mirus Bio, Cat#MIR2250). To produce virus from in vitro transcribed RNA, BHK-21 cells were seeded in a 100cm dish at a density of 2 x 106 cells the day before transfection. A total of 4 \u03bcg of viral RNA was then transfected in each dish, and virus was harvested 36 to 48 hrs post-transfection. For replicon assays, cells were plated at a density of 5 x 104 cells per well in 24-well plates the day before transfection. 100 ng viral replicon RNA was then transfected into cells. Transfected cells were then harvested at the indicated time points using Renilla lysis buffer. Renilla luciferase activity was quantified using the Renilla Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Cat# E2820). Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 1 x 105 cells per well the day before infection. The cells were infected with VEEV-TC83-GFP at MOI of 20 and incubated with cells for 1.5 h at 4\u00b0C with horizontal shaking every 20\u201330 minutes. Unbound viruses were then washed off using chilled PBS. After the final wash, 200 \u03bcL FBS free DMEM was added into the wells, and the plates were placed in -80\u00b0C for at least 2h. After three freeze-thaw cycles, bound and internalized virus was quantified by real-time PCR detecting VEEV-TC83 nsP3 gene. For VEEV-NLuc\/Cap binding assay, cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 5 x 104 cells per well the day before infection. The cells were infected with VEEV-NLuc\/Cap at MOI of 1 or 10 and incubated with cells for 1.5 h at 4\u00b0C with horizontal shaking every 20\u201330 minutes. Unbound viruses were then washed off using chilled PBS for 4 washes. After the final wash, add 150 \u03bcL NP40 lysis buffer into the wells and plates were stored in the -80\u00b0C freezer. The NLuc activity was determined by using Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System. BHK-21 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 2 x 105 cells per well the day before infection. The cells were infected with diluted virus in 200\u03bcL medium and bound to cells at 37\u00b0C for 1.5h. Then the cells were covered by Avicel overlay medium [60], and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 days. Plaques were then visualized by crystal violet staining. Total RNA from tissue culture cells was extracted using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Cat#74106) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Total RNA from mouse tissue was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). For RT-PCR assays, SuperScript IV First-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen, Cat#18091050) was used to generate the complementary DNA template. For confocal immunofluorescence studies, the indicated antibodies and dyes were diluted in 5% BSA in PBS as below: mouse anti-Flag (ProteinTech, Cat#66008-4-Ig, 1:5,000), goat-anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-488 (Invitrogen, 1:1,000), goat-anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-488 (Invitrogen, 1:1,000), goat-anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor-647 (Invitrogen, 1:1,000), DAPI (4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) was used for staining of nuclei. Images were collected by using ZEISS LSM 880 with Airyscan system at the core facility at Life Science Institute, Zhejiang University. Tissue culture cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 (NP-40) buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v\/v) NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, protease inhibitor cocktail) and incubated on ice for 30min, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. For mouse tissue lysates, fresh tissues were collected in 2ml round-bottom Eppendorf tubes containing NP40 lysis buffer and cut into small pieces using scissors. Western blot analyses were then performed as previously described [61]. HeLa cells were transduced with lentivirus expressing TurboID-HA or TRIM32-TurboID-HA to generate HeLa-TurboID.HA and HeLa-TRIM32-TurboID-HA. Cells were seeded in 100mm dishes at a density of 5 x 106 cells per dish. The cells were mock infected or infected with VEEV-TC83-GFP at MOI of 25 in the presence of biotin at a concentration of 500 \u03bcM. The cells were collected at 6 hour post infection (hpi), and biotinylated proteins were enriched as previously described [62]. The biotinylation efficiency confirmed by western blot. To prepare proteomic samples for mass spectrometry analysis, the enriched proteins were separated on a gradient gel (GenScript, 4\u201320% precast polyacrylamide gel) at 120V for 5~10 min, until the protein ladder ran ~1cm into gel. Then the gel was stained with Coomassie blue (G-250) for 1h at room temperature. After destaining in buffer containing 45%(v\/v) methanol, 10% (v\/v) acetic acid in HPLC-grade water the stained area was cut into slices and each slice was placed into an Eppendorf 1.5 mL tube, which had been previously rinsed with 50% acetone and millipure water. Proteins were identified by mass spectrometry by the Protein Chemistry Facility at the Center for Biomedical Analysis of Tsinghua University. The protein-protein interaction networks were analyzed by using Venny 2.1 [63] and PANTHER [64]. The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: mouse anti-Flag (Sigma, M2, 1:5,000), rabbit anti-Flag (ProteinTech, 1:5,000), mouse anti-GAPDH (Abclonal, Cat#AC002, 1:5,000), rabbit anti-TRIM32 (ProteinTech, Cat# 10326-1-AP, 1:1,000), rabbit anti-STING (ProteinTech, Cat#19851-1-AP, 1:1,000), mouse anti-STAT1 (Proteintech, Cat#66545-1-Ig, 1:1,000), Rabbit-anti-TBK1 (ProteinTech, Cat# 28397-1-AP, 1:1,000). For western blotting, antibodies were diluted in 5% (w\/v) non-fat dry milk in TBST buffer. For immunofluorescence assay, the antibodies were diluted in 5% (w\/v) BSA in PBS. D-biotin (Sangon Biotech, Cat# A100340), Streptavidin MagBeads (GenScript, Cat#L00936), Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Cat#N1110), Renilla-Lumi Plus (Beyotime, Cat#RG066S), Cycloheximide (4A Biotech, Cat#FXP130-10), ML336 (TargetMol, Cat#T21900-1).

Studies in traditional laboratory rodents, including mice and rats, have supported the idea that short-term social isolation promotes affiliative social behaviors, while long-term isolation promotes anti-social behaviors, including increased aggression. Whether the effects of isolation on the social behaviors of mice and rats generalize to other rodents remains understudied. In the current study, we characterized the effects of short-term (3-days) social isolation on the social behaviors of adult prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) during same-sex and opposite-sex social interactions. Our experiments revealed that short-term isolation did not affect rates of ultrasonic vocalizations or time spent in non-aggressive social behaviors and huddling during same-sex and opposite-sex interactions. Unexpectedly, although short-term isolation also did not affect time spent in resident-initiated and mutually-initiated aggressive behavior, we found that short-term isolation increased time spent in visitor-initiated aggression during male-male interactions. Our findings highlight the importance of comparative work across species and the consideration of social context to understand the diverse ways in which social isolation can impact social behavior.

Social isolation is increasingly recognized as a contributor to the development of mental and physical illnesses [1\u20135]. For example, in humans, feelings of loneliness are correlated with increased rates of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and decreased cognitive function [6\u20139]. Furthermore, social isolation promotes markers of inflammation, exacerbates cardiovascular conditions, disrupts sleep quality, and dysregulates stress response reactivity [10\u201313]. On the other hand, social support has been shown to mitigate the deleterious effects of physiological and psychological stressors [14, 15]. Social connectedness reduces the likelihood of depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder [16\u201318]. Thus, an overwhelming amount of evidence highlights the importance of our social environment to our well-being. Humans, however, are not the only animals that are affected by their social environment. Social isolation is an impactful stressor with lasting effects on the brain and behavior across a variety of mammals [19, 20]. In rodents, for example, social isolation increases levels of systemic inflammation and promotes anxiety-like and despair-like behaviors [21\u201323]. As in humans, social support in rodents buffers the effects of stressors, improves social investigation, and diminishes fear responses [14, 15, 24]. The consistent association between the quality (or absence) of social connections and psychophysiological health outcomes is a fundamental aspect of social animals across various taxa including primates, birds, fish, and invertebrates [20, 25]. In addition to effects on health outcomes, social isolation is well known to affect social behavior, and extensive literature has investigated the effects of long-term (> 2 weeks) social isolation on the social behaviors of traditional laboratory rodents, including mice and rats. Although a small number of studies in rats have reported that long-term isolation promotes social investigation during subsequent social interactions [26, 27], numerous studies in both rats and mice found that long-term isolation promotes anti-social behaviors, including decreasing social approach and social preference [28], increasing anxiety [29, 30], and increasing aggression [21, 31\u201334]. Despite the accumulating evidence that social isolation fundamentally impacts many aspects of health and wellbeing, studies have primarily focused on the effects of long-term isolation at the cost of investigating short-term periods of isolation and the consequences that follow. This lack of research is notable because most social organisms do not experience long-term isolation under natural conditions, whereas short-term isolation is sure to be common in nature and therefore more ecologically valid. A small number of studies in mice and rats have reported that short-term (< 2 weeks) isolation increases social motivation during subsequent interactions with conspecifics. Short-term isolation increases social investigation and social grooming in male rats [35], increases play behaviors in juvenile rats [36], and increases social preference in male mice [37]. Given that prior work has tended to focus on the effects of social isolation on male behavior, we recently characterized the effects of short-term isolation on the social behaviors of both female and male mice during opposite-sex and same-sex interactions [38]. We found that although short-term isolation exerted relatively subtle effects on the social behaviors of male mice when they subsequently interacted with male and female social partners, female mice exhibited robust changes in social behavior following a 3-day period of isolation. Compared to group-housed females, single-housed females spent more time investigating a novel female social partner, produced higher rates of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during same-sex interactions, and engaged in same-sex mounting of novel females [38]. Studies such as these support the idea that short-term isolation can influence social behavior in mice and rats and highlight the importance of considering whether such effects vary according to sex and social context. Whether the effects of short-term isolation on the social behaviors of mice and rats generalize to less traditional rodent models remains unknown. Although work in traditional laboratory animals has established that both long-term and short-term isolation can impact social behavior, the relevance of such work to humans may be limited because these rodents do not demonstrate persistent and selective social bonds characteristic of humans. Species with prolonged social bonds across their lives, such as the prairie vole, may be particularly affected by social isolation [24, 39\u201341] and therefore may be more suitable to model the effects of social isolation on human social behavior. Most prairie voles will form socially monogamous pairs and engage in biparental care [42\u201344]. Moreover, under natural conditions, some prairie voles disperse from the nest to establish their own territories, whereas others remain at the nest living in communal groups as adults [45]. Thus, prairie voles are likely to experience a range of periods of social isolation and communal living during their natural lives. Indeed, research has demonstrated that social isolation from cage-mate siblings is sufficient to produce changes in prairie vole behavior and physiology similar to those observed in humans, including increased indicators of learned helplessness and anhedonia, decreased exploratory behavior, and disruption of autonomic, cardiac, and immune functions [39, 46\u201355]. Social isolation has also been shown to impact the social behaviors of prairie voles. For instance, social isolation can increase aggression towards same-sex conspecifics and pups [46, 51]. In social affiliation tests, socially isolated prairie voles have been found to spend more time in a social chamber, spend more time sniffing an unfamiliar conspecific, and spend less time grooming and huddling with an unfamiliar conspecific [52, 54, 56]. Notably, like work with traditional laboratory rodents, most of these studies have focused on the effects of long-term social isolation [47, 48, 52, 57, 58]. Considerably less research exists on the effects of short-term social isolation on the social behavior of prairie voles. Here, we replicate the design of our recent work in mice [38] to ask how short-term (3-day) social isolation affects the social behaviors of female and male prairie voles. We considered the effects of short-term isolation on both aggressive and non-aggressive social behaviors. We also measured the effects of short-term isolation on the production of USVs. Previous studies have found that rates and acoustic features of rodent USVs are responsive to both short- and long-term social isolation [38, 59\u201362], and prairie voles produce USVs during social encounters [63\u201365]. In addition, because voles may experience different types of social motivation during different social contexts [66], we tested the effects of short-term social isolation on these social behaviors produced during female-female interactions, male-male interactions, and male-female interactions. Male and female prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) used in this experiment were F2 and F3 generation lab-born animals derived from wild-caught breeders trapped in Champaign County, Illinois, USA. Subjects born to F1 or F2 breeders were housed with parents and littermates until weaning at postnatal day (PND) 21, housed with all littermates until PND42-45, and then separated by sex and housed with their same-sex littermates until the start of the experiment (> PND60). All animals were housed in standard polycarbonate rodent cages (29 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 13 cm) lined with Sani-chip bedding and provided nesting material. We provided animals free access to water and food (Rodent Chow 5001, LabDiet, St. Louis, MO, USA). All animals were housed on a 14:10 light-dark cycle with ambient temperature maintained at 20 \u00b1 2\u00b0C. Sex was assigned based on external genitalia. All experiments and procedures were conducted according to protocols approved by the Cornell University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocols #2020\u2013001 and #2013\u20130090). We used a between-subjects design to measure the effects of short-term (3-day) social isolation on the social behaviors of sexually na\u00efve, non-bonded, adult (> PND60) prairie voles during same-sex and opposite-sex interactions. Subjects were selected from cages housing at least two adult, same-sex littermates. One sibling from each cage was assigned to the single-housed condition and was separated from its littermate(s) and housed alone for three days in a clean cage with bedding and nesting material prior to being placed in a social interaction test (see below). A second sibling from each cage was assigned to the group-housed condition. Group-housed subjects were removed from their home cage and were placed directly in the social interaction test. If a selected litter had more than two same-sex siblings, all remaining siblings from that litter were transferred to a new home cage and were not used in the experiment. The social interaction test began by transferring a subject (either group-housed or single-housed) within its home cage into a custom-made Plexiglas chamber (29 \u00d7 18 \u00d7 13 cm) that fit snugly around the home cage to prevent animals from escaping when the cage lid was removed. The home cage and its Plexiglas \u2018sleeve\u2019 were placed inside a sound-attenuating recording chamber (Med Associates) equipped with an ultrasonic microphone (Avisoft, CMPA\/CM16), an infrared light source (Tendelux), and a webcam (Logitech, with the infrared filter removed to enable video recording under infrared lighting) (S1 Fig). Because these animals were tested in their home cages, we refer to subjects as \u201cresidents\u201d. Resident voles were sexually na\u00efve at the time of the experiment and had no prior social experience outside of littermate interactions. An unrelated and unfamiliar group-housed stimulus animal (i.e., a \u201cvisitor\u201d) was then placed in the resident\u2019s home cage for 30 minutes, and video and audio recordings were made. Visitors were used across multiple trials. Three out of 13 female visitors were used across both male-female and female-female trials. No visitor was used more than 11 times within 60 days and there was always at least 1 day between uses in different trials. Visitors were individually ear-tagged prior to being used in a social interaction test for identification purposes. We measured social behaviors (see below) during social interaction testing in three social contexts. In the first context, we tested female residents when exposed to a female visitor (FF). In the second context, we tested male residents when exposed to a male visitor (MM). In the third context, we tested male residents when exposed to a female visitor (MF). For each context, we assigned 15 subjects to serve in the group-housed condition and 15 subjects to serve in the single-housed condition. A subset of social interaction tests (n = 17) were excluded from analysis for one of the three following reasons: (1) an animal jumped on top of the Plexiglas chamber and\/or onto the microphone (n = 10), (2) the recording was stopped before the 30-minute mark due to experimenter error (n = 3), or (3) the visitor identity was not recorded (n = 4). Thus, our final sample sizes for FF were n = 15 (group-housed) and n = 15 (single-housed), for MM were n = 14 (group-housed) and n = 14 (single-housed), and for MF were n = 12 (group-housed) and n = 13 (single-housed). USVs were recorded using an Avisoft recording system (UltrasoundGate 116H, 250 kHz sample rate) and detected using custom MATLAB codes with the following parameters implemented to detect prairie vole USVs: mean frequency > 17 kHz; spectral purity > 0.3; spectral discontinuity < 1.00; minimum USV duration = 5 ms; minimum inter-syllable interval = 30 ms) [38, 67]. Because recordings were unable to distinguish whether the resident or the visitor produced a given USV, we simply counted the total number of USVs produced by a dyad within a trial. To evaluate the accuracy of our USV detection, we generated spectrograms of each detected \u2018putative\u2019 USV from eight representative 30-minute-long audio recordings from our dataset (n = 5800 putative USVs detected in total; from n = 4 male-male trials, n = 1 female-female trials, and n = 3 male-female trials). A trained observer rated each spectrogram as either containing a USV or not containing a USV. From this analysis, we calculated that 91.2 +\/- 3.6% (in total, 5305 of 5800) of putative USVs detected by the code are true USVs, and correspondingly, we estimate a false positive rate of ~8.8%. Trained observers, blinded to context, scored behaviors from overhead video recordings of the resident and visitor in each pair. One of the authors (N.M.P.) initially scored behavior from a subset of videos in our dataset (n = 5) that collectively contained instances of all behaviors to be scored. Three additional observers were then trained on this training dataset until their scoring reached 100% agreement with that of the trainer. Outside of the training dataset, each video was scored by only one observer, and the trainer continued to perform intermittent spot checks of scoring accuracy. A spreadsheet was used to record start and stop times for each behavior. The following behaviors were scored: (1) resident-initiated aggressive behavior, (2) visitor-initiated aggressive behavior, (3) mutually-initiated aggressive behavior, (4) resident-initiated non-aggressive behavior, (5) visitor-initiated non-aggressive behavior, (6) mutually-initiated non-aggressive behavior, and (7) huddling. Aggressive behavior included chasing (i.e., pursuit associated with fighting) and fighting (i.e., biting, boxing, or tussling). Non-aggressive behavior included sniffing, following (i.e., pursuit not associated with fighting), and grooming. For both aggressive and non-aggressive behavior, directional behavior (i.e., resident-initiated or visitor-initiated) was defined as instances in which one animal approached the other and the behaviors listed above resulted. Mutually-initiated behavior was defined as instances in which the two animals simultaneously approached each other and the behaviors above resulted. Huddling was defined as instances when the resident and visitor remained in side-by-side physical contact for more than 3 seconds without otherwise interacting. Thus, we scored aggressive behavior, non-aggressive behavior, and huddling as mutually exclusive, non-simultaneous events. No instances of mounting were observed in our dataset. To examine normality of residuals for the relevant data distributions, we visually inspected quantile plots of residuals. Cases in which residuals diverged notably from the 45-degree line of a normal distribution were deemed non-normally distributed and were analyzed by fitting the data to a generalized linear mixed model with a negative binomial family. We quantified huddling behavior as a binary variable (Y\/N) and then analyzed it by fitting it to a generalized linear mixed model with a binomial family. We did not analyze the number of seconds animals were engaged in huddling because very few pairs engaged in any huddling behavior (n = 20\/83). All models included \u2018visitor identity\u2019 as a random factor to control for the fact that some visitors were used across multiple trials. All p-values for pairwise comparisons were corrected for multiple comparisons using the Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) test. Summary statistics provided in text represent mean values \u00b1 standard deviation. All statistical analyses were carried out using R 4.3.0 (R Core Team, 2023) and R Studio 2023.03.1+446 (Posit team, 2023). Rates of USVs produced by prairie vole pairs significantly differed as a function of social context (Fig 1; \u03a72 = 33.14, p < 0.001). However, we found no effect of resident housing condition on USV production (\u03a72 = 0.87, p = 0.35), and the interaction between social context and housing condition was also not significant (\u03a72 = 0.31, p = 0.86). Notably, MF pairs produced an average of 1174.9 \u00b1 993.3 USVs, significantly more than both FF pairs (368.4 \u00b1 258.7) and MM pairs (447.0 \u00b1 306.2) (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). These data indicate that prairie vole USV rates are influenced by social context but are not affected by short-term isolation.

Time spent engaged in aggressive behavior initiated by the resident did not differ by resident housing condition (Fig 2A; \u03a72 = 1.41, p = 0.23) or by social context (\u03a72 = 5.14, p = 0.08), and these factors did not show a significant interaction (\u03a72 = 3.38, p = 0.18).

Unexpectedly, although visitor-initiated aggressive behavior did not show a significant main effect of resident housing condition (Fig 2C; \u03a72 = 1.5, p = 0.22) or social context (\u03a72 = 1.78, p = 0.41), the interaction between these two factors was significant (\u03a72 = 6.08, p = 0.048). Post hoc comparisons revealed that MM pairs with a single-housed resident spent more time engaged in visitor-initiated aggressive behavior than pairs with a group-housed resident (40.3 \u00b1 26.9 s and 15.0 \u00b1 13.4 s, respectively; p = 0.01). Furthermore, all visitor males (4 total) that were used in MM trials were tested with both single-housed residents and group-housed residents. Notably, 3 of these 4 male visitors spent more time engaged in visitor-initiated aggression during trials with single-housed residents compared to trials with group-housed residents (S2 Fig). Follow-up analyses demonstrated that both the mean number of visitor-initiated bouts of aggressive behavior and the mean duration of these bouts were significantly greater in MM trials with single-housed residents when compared to trials with group-housed residents (\u03a72 = 4.7, p = 0.03 for bout number analysis; \u03a72 = 5.5, p = 0.02 for bout duration analysis). In summary, MM pairs with single-housed residents spent more time engaged in visitor-initiated aggression compared to MM pairs with group-housed residents. These data reveal a sex- and context-dependent effect of short-term social isolation on visitor-initiated aggressive behavior. We next considered the effects of short-term isolation on prairie vole non-aggressive social behavior by categorizing periods of non-aggressive behavior as resident-initiated, mutual, or visitor-initiated. Time spent in resident-initiated non-aggressive social behavior showed a significant main effect of social context (Fig 3A; \u03a72 = 8.90, p = 0.01), but there was no significant main effect of resident housing condition (\u03a72 = 0.52, p = 0.47), and there was no significant interaction between resident housing condition and social context (\u03a72 = 3.01, p = 0.22). Post hoc comparisons among prairie vole dyads showed that MM pairs (26.1 \u00b1 54.6 s) spent significantly less time engaged in resident-initiated non-aggressive social behaviors than MF pairs (80.1 \u00b1 85.9 s; p = 0.03) and FF pairs (77.2 \u00b1 157.7 s; p = 0.02).

Post hoc comparisons showed that MM pairs spent less time engaged in mutually-initiated non-aggressive social behavior than FF pairs (37.1 \u00b1 43.2 and 26.5 \u00b1 86.2 s, respectively; p = 0.049). Finally, visitor-initiated non-aggressive social behavior showed the same pattern, where we found a significant main effect of social context (Fig 3C; \u03a72 = 12.25, p = 0.002) but no significant main effect of resident housing condition (\u03a72 = 1.05, p = 0.30) and no significant interaction between resident housing condition and social context (\u03a72 = 0.24, p = 0.88). Post hoc comparisons showed that MM pairs (30.7 \u00b1 45.2 s) spent significantly less time engaged in visitor-initiated non-aggressive social behaviors than MF pairs (122.7 \u00b1 96.7 s; p = 0.02) and FF pairs (85.1 \u00b1 133.8 s; p = 0.03). Taken together, these results indicate that prairie vole non-aggressive social behavior is influenced by social context but is not impacted by short-term isolation. Although huddling (i.e., side-by-side contact) was rare among resident-visitor pairs (20 of 83 pairs engaged in huddling behavior; see S3 Fig), our results showed a significant main effect of social context on the number of pairs that engaged in huddling (Fig 3D; \u03a72 = 6.04, p = 0.049). However, we did not find a significant main effect of resident housing condition (\u03a72 = 0.31, p = 0.58) or a significant interaction between resident housing condition and social context (\u03a72 = 0.27, p = 0.87). Post hoc comparisons showed that huddling was observed more frequently in MF pairs than in MM pairs (11 of 25 MF pairs huddled and 2 of 28 MM pairs huddled; p = 0.047). As with non-aggressive social behavior, our data indicate that frequency of huddling differs by social context but is not affected by short-term isolation. In this study, we measured the effects of short-term social isolation on social behaviors in prairie voles, during same-sex and opposite-sex social interactions. Surprisingly, we found that three days of social isolation did not impact rates of USV production, time spent engaged in non-aggressive social behaviors, or frequency of huddling (Figs 1 and 3). Similarly, we found no main effect of social isolation or social context on time spent in aggressive behavior (Fig 2). However, we did find that short-term isolation increased visitor-initiated aggression in a context-dependent manner, where social isolation did not impact MF or FF dyads, but MM pairs with a single-housed resident spent more time engaged in visitor-initiated aggression than MM pairs with a group-housed resident (Fig 2C). On the other hand, social context of the dyads (MF, FF, or MM) strongly influenced rates of USV production, non-aggressive behavior, and huddling. MF pairs produced higher rates of USVs than same-sex pairs (Fig 1B), MF and FF pairs spent significantly more time engaged in non-aggressive behaviors compared to MM pairs (Fig 3A and 3C), and significantly more MF pairs engaged in huddling than MM pairs (Fig 3D). Previous work in mice and rats has demonstrated that short-term (< 2 weeks) social isolation promotes a variety of social behaviors, including social play [36], social investigation [37, 38], USV production [38], mounting [35, 38], and grooming [35]. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to consider the effects of short-term isolation on the social behaviors of freely interacting, adult prairie voles. In contrast to work in mice and rats, most behaviors that we measured (USVs, non-aggressive behaviors, and huddling) were surprisingly not affected by short-term isolation. Similarly, Sailer et al. (2022) found that juvenile prairie voles that experienced 9 days of social isolation engaged in social approach toward and social investigation of a conspecific behind a physical barrier at rates that were no different from animals that were not isolated. It is worth noting that combining social isolation while also exposing animals to a social stress regimen (i.e., chronic social defeat), however, reduced these behaviors [24]. Taken together, these studies suggest that prairie voles might not be as sensitive to short-term social isolation as mice or rats. This difference highlights the importance of comparative studies across species for understanding how social isolation impacts behavior. Although we found that short-term isolation exerted relatively few effects on prairie vole social behavior, aggressive interactions among our dyads were influenced by social isolation; however, this effect depended on social context. Unexpectedly, we found that 3 days of social isolation promoted prairie vole aggression, but only among male-male dyads. Moreover, these behavioral differences were only observed in the visitors\u2019 aggression. How might single-housing of the resident male increase aggressive behavior of the visitor male? One possibility is that although single-housed male residents did not initiate more fights, perhaps they either promoted or prolonged altercations or perhaps they were less effective at defusing visitor-initiated aggression compared to group-housed male residents. These ideas are aligned with the hypothesis that social isolation results in a deficiency of social skills, although this hypothesis has mainly been discussed in the context of early-life social isolation and subsequent overexpression of aggression or altered courtship behaviors later in life [59, 68]. A second more practical possibility is that visitor males responded with aggression towards behaviors exhibited by single-housed resident males, but we did not capture these behaviors in our video analysis, either because they were more subtle behaviors than those that we scored (for example, postural differences) or because they could not be captured by video recordings (for example, differences in chemical signaling). Unfortunately, we are unable to distinguish between these possibilities based on the data we collected. Nevertheless, our data complement previous work showing that longer-term isolation increases aggressive behavior in female prairie voles [46, 51]. Different social contexts created by the dyads that we established impacted non-aggressive behaviors and the rates of USVs. However, the contexts impacted these behaviors differently. In many ways, the social context among dyads led to predictable outcomes. For instance, both MF and FF pairs spent more time engaged in non-aggressive behaviors than MM pairs (Fig 3A and 3C), a result that is likely best explained by intersexual competition among males. Moreover, MF pairs spent the most time engaged in social behaviors that are typically considered prosocial. Indeed, male-female pairs produced higher rates of USVs than same-sex pairs (Fig 1B) and were more likely to exhibit huddling than male-male pairs (Fig 3D). Presumably these differences in behavior are related to the reproductive context that tends to follow male-female pairings. Notably, the finding that MF pairs produced the overall highest rates of USVs aligns with previous work, which found that MF pairs of prairie voles emit higher rates of USVs than MM pairs [64, 65], and that USV production during opposite-sex interactions accompanies social investigation, mounting, and intromission [63]. Previous studies in prairie voles have manually categorized USV types (based on spectrographic shape) produced during same-sex interactions [64], described the acoustic features of USVs produced during opposite-sex interactions [63], and reported that the acoustic features of vole USVs covary with heart rate [69]. Whether the acoustic features of prairie vole USVs differ according to social context or are influenced by social isolation remains an important topic for future study. Recent work has put forth the idea of social homeostasis, in which individuals detect the quality and quantity of social interaction, compare it to a \u201cset-point\u201d of optimal social contact, and then modify their social seeking behaviors to achieve optimal social contact. Specifically, the social homeostasis hypothesis proposes that animals increase their rates of prosocial behaviors following short periods of social isolation, but that long-term isolation alters the social set-point, which in turn makes social contact a negative valence stimulus and causes individuals to increase their rates of anti-social behaviors, including aggression [70]. Notably, the patterns of social behaviors that we report are inconsistent with the predictions of this hypothesis. Indeed, none of the prosocial behaviors we measured were impacted by short-term social isolation. In contrast, we found that short-term social isolation leads to a social context-dependent increase in visitor-initiated aggressive behavior. Given that most studies in prairie voles have focused on prolonged periods (> 4 weeks) of social isolation, additional work is needed to understand the time course over which aggressive behaviors emerge in single-housed females and males. Similarly, it would be interesting to know whether there are conditions under which short-term isolation enhances prosocial behaviors in prairie voles. For example, group-housed and single-housed resident prairie voles in the current study were given social interactions with unfamiliar visitors. Yet it is possible that the effects of short-term isolation on vole social behaviors might differ if subsequent interactions were conducted with familiar voles. This distinction in the familiarity of the visitor may be relevant considering that exposure to familiar and unfamiliar conspecifics (or even unfamiliar heterospecifics) elicits different patterns of neuronal activation throughout the \u2018social behavior network\u2019 in the prairie vole brain [71]. In summary, our study highlights the paramount importance of considering factors that can influence whether and how isolation affects social behavior. In particular, the duration and timing of isolation, the natural history of the species studied, and the sex of the social interactants are all critical factors that merit consideration. Doing so will lead to a deeper understanding of the various ways in which social isolation impacts social behavior and mental and physical health.

Sagility India made a decent debut on the stock market, listing at Rs. 31.06 per share, a 3.53% gain over its issue price of Rs. 30.

Despite recent market volatility and significant foreign outflows, the resilience of domestic retail investors in India is at its highest. In October 2024, mutual fund net inflows reached a remarkable \u20b92.40 lakh crore, pushing the industry\u2019s AUM to an all-time high of \u20b967.26 lakh crore. Equity-oriented schemes saw their highest monthly inflows, attracting \u20b941,887 crore, clearly demonstrating investor confidence in the equity market. This increase from September\u2019s inflows highlights a strong and unwavering commitment by retail investors, even in the face of market fluctuations. Notably, around 30%(\u20b912,278.78 crore) of these new flows were directed toward thematic funds, marking one of the highest allocations to these focused investments. This trend suggests that retail investors are now more willing than ever to take calculated risks, betting on specific sectors or investment themes for potential growth. This shift underscores a change in retail investor preferences, as they increasingly look beyond traditional broad-market funds. Investors are showing their highest levels of interest in exploring specific themes and sectors, embracing riskier opportunities for potentially higher returns\u201d -- Karthick Jonagadla, smallcase Manager and Founder of Quantace Research Profectus Capital Private Limited (PCPL), an NBFC backed by Actis, a global private equity firm, announced impressive performance during the half year ended 30th September 2024.

Oct\u201924 saw the Indian equity markets (Nifty 50 index) correcting ~6% (closing 8% lower from its all-time high). India saw FII outflows of INR 1.1 tn (USD 13.5 bn) due to a weak earnings season, expensive Indian market and inflows into other markets. FII selling was however counter-balanced by INR 1.07 tn (USD 12.9 bn) of domestic inflows. A key driver of this, is the increasing retail participation in equity markets through SIP flows (up from INR 31 bn\/month in Apr\u201916 to INR 253 bn\/month in Oct\u201924) FII selling impact could have been sharper (but for DII support): Significant FII outflows have historically led to sharp corrections in the Indian markets. In most instances wherein the Nifty 50 has declined > 5% in a month, FII flows have been negative. Interestingly, despite the highest-ever monthly FII outflows (INR 1.1 tn) in Oct\u201924, Indian equity markets fell only 6%, remaining fairly resilient due to DIIs counter-balancing with INR 1.07 tn (USD 12.9 bn) of inflows. A key driver of this is the increasing retail participation in equity markets through SIP flows (up from INR 31 bn\/month in Apr\u201916 to INR 253 bn\/month in Oct\u201924). Weak earnings, >+1 SD valuations, other exciting opportunities drive FII outflows: Intense selling across FIIs can be attributed to: (1) A weak earnings season (Analysis of 157 companies out of the JMFL coverage of 275 suggest 44% (69 companies) missed Q2 estimates, 41% (65 companies) beat Q2 estimates while 15% (23 companies) were inline); (2) An overvalued Indian equity market (Nifty valuations through Jul\u201924 to Sep\u201924 suggest Nifty 1 year forward was >+1 standard deviation (21.6x) above mean; (3) Flow of foreign capital into other markets.

Major Changes in Direct Tax Code 2025 Removal of Assessment and Previous Year Concepts:\u00a0 The code removes the terms \u201cAssessment Year\u201d and \u201cPrevious Year\u201d.\u00a0 Only the term- \u201cFinancial Year\u201d will be applicable for tax filing. Capital Gains Tax Changes: Capital gains will be taxed as regular income.\u00a0 Short-term gains on financial assets will be taxed at 20% (up from 15%), while long-term gains will be taxed at 12.5% (down from 20%). Simplified Residential Status: Taxpayers will be classified as either residents or non-residents, eliminating the RNOR (Resident but Not Ordinarily Resident) category.\u00a0 New Income Category Names: \u201cIncome from Salary\u201d is now called \u201cEmployment Income,\u201d and \u201cIncome from Other Sources\u201d is renamed \u201cIncome from Residuary Sources.\u201d\u00a0 Expanded Tax Audit Roles: Company Secretaries (CS) and Cost and Management Accountants (CMA) may now be allowed to conduct tax audits, which was previously limited to Chartered Accountants (CAs), making tax audits more accessible. Unified Company Tax Rates: Both domestic and foreign companies will now pay the same tax rate, making compliance easier and encouraging foreign investment. TDS and TCS on Most Income: Under the new tax system, Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) and Tax Collected at Source (TCS) will apply to nearly all types of income. This ensures taxes are paid more regularly. The TDS rate for many payments will drop from 5% to 2%. For e-commerce operators, the TDS rate will significantly decrease from 1% to 0.1%, offering relief to taxpayers and simplifying compliance for e-commerce businesses. Fewer Deductions and Exemptions: Most deductions and exemptions will be removed, streamlining tax filing.\u00a0 However, the standard deduction for salaried employees in the new tax regime has increased to \u20b975,000, a 50% rise. 1.

The area defined by yesterday\u2019s lows is key also because there is a falling channel from early October offering support here. Weekly momentum is deeply oversold but in strong downtrends that happens often, so the burden of proof is on the market to at least take out the previous day\u2019s high while holding support. Until that happens, bears will hold sway with the next important downside zone in the 23200 - 23300 area. Niva Bupa Health Insurance made a positive debut on the stock market, listing at Rs 78.14, a 5.5% premium over its issue price of Rs 74. This performance was slightly better than expected. The IPO, which was moderately subscribed 1.9 times, reflected a cautious investor sentiment, potentially influenced by the company\u2019s recent negative quarterly earnings. While Niva Bupa has shown strong growth and a positive turnaround in recent years, the short-term performance concerns and the IPO\u2019s pricing seemed to have tempered investor enthusiasm. Investors who participated in the IPO can consider holding their shares, but should closely monitor the company\u2019s performance and the broader market conditions. New investors may want to wait for a clearer picture of the company\u2019s future trajectory before investing.

At the time of writing this piece, the US dollar has reached 106 while cryptos are hitting all-time highs \u2013 equity markets are doing well. This is all causing gold to pick up momentum on the downsides \u2013 in fact the break below 2600 saw massive volumes confirming the trend reversal. A daily close below the prior trend low of 2,590 has confirmed a near term bear trend and the next support comes in around 2534 levels followed by 2470 levels. As sellers remain dominant currently and no near term positive triggers likely the next lower target zone is looking more likely before this correction is over.\u201d Inox Green Energy shares rose 2.78% on the NSE to \u20b9152.75 following board\u2019s approval for the demerger of the company\u2019s power evacuation business.

CMP: Rs370; TP: Rs760; Upside: 106%; Rating: BUY ~ We retain our TP of Rs760 (unchanged) with a BUY rating on Ritco Logistics (Ritco). In Q2FY25, Ritco delivered robust revenue growth of 18.9% yoy, navigating a challenging economic landscape while sustaining healthy margins of 7.7%.\u00a0 ~ All indicators suggest that Ritco is poised for accelerated growth, outpacing industry trends due to new customers in the FTL business, significant contributions from TrucksUp and ramp-up of multimodal logistics.\u00a0 ~ TrucksUp has gained significant traction, with ~2 lakh downloads (up from 1.7 lakh in Aug\u201924) and over 500 business associates now subscribed to its services.\u00a0 ~ TrucksUp is set to be a game changer for Ritco and industry as it gains scale over FY26-27E and we expect it to contribute significantly to the consolidated PAT in FY27E.\u00a0 ~ Excluding any impact from value added services which is under evaluation stage from monetization point of view, we expect a margin and ROE\/ ROCE expansion and very robust growth coming together for Ritco, buttressing a possible re-rating. CMP: Rs1870; TP: Rs2540; Rating: Accumulate (under revision) Revenue: Rs2.3bn; +20% yoy; -5% qoq. Revenue was a miss to our estimates. Total volumes grew by ~30% yoy but blended realisation declined 10% yoy due to correction in steel prices. Exports were 1\/3rd of total revenues. Some orders were delayed due to heavy monsoon. Gross margins: 34% vs 28.4% yoy and 33% qoq. EBITDA: Rs410mn; +18% yoy; -15% qoq EBITDA margins: 17.9% vs 18.1% yoy and 20% qoq. The qoq decline was largely due to high other expenses driven by increase in ocean freight (export proportion increased) and also increase in stores and spares cost. PAT: Rs237mn; +17%yoy; -14% qoq Our view: 2QFY25 was a miss to our estimate both on revenue and margins due to monsoon related disruption and pricing correction along with rise in other expenses. Export witnessed very strong growth. Going ahead, volumes are expected to recover due to strong order book (Rs3.4bn) but margins may remain at the same level due to permanent increase in other expenses. Growth triggers for the company include capacity expansion in fittings and high-grade titanium pipes, ramp up of exports and approvals into new end user industries. We will revise our estimates shortly. CMP: Rs5440; TP: Rs5900; Upside: 8%; Rating: ACCUMULATE ~ We raise TP to Rs5900 (previously Rs5000) and move to Accumulate rating on Vesuvius India Ltd (VIL).\u00a0 ~ Rise in TP is due to increase in target multiple, valuation rollover partially offset by slight reduction in earnings estimates.\u00a0 ~ The main message from VIL\u2019s Vizag analyst meet was that a focused approach on growth and investment will continue where it will not enter commoditized products and will increase its large market share in flow control by expanding selectively into products having technical expertise and value add for its customers. This will be further complemented by its increasing revenue from total refractory management services contracts.\u00a0 ~ With another Rs5bn of capex over 3-5years, strong growth, net cash balance and a best in industry return ratios, we expect VIL to command premium multiple.\u00a0 ~ We remain positive on the long-term prospects and believe VIL can be a consistent story but are constrained by expensive valuations.\u00a0  SPICEJET LTD - SETTLEMENT MARKS MAJOR FINANCIAL MILESTONE FOR SPICEJET\u00a0 SPICEJET LTD - GETS OWNERSHIP OF 13 Q400 AIRCRAFT, REDUCING OPERATIONAL COSTS, RENTAL EXPENSES\u00a0  SPICEJET LTD - PAYS $22.5 MLN TO RESOLVE $90.8 MLN EDC DISPUTE, SAVES $68.3 MLN\u00a0  INDIA TRADE MINISTER TO CNBC TV18: HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ANTI-HYBRID VEHICHLES, BUT NOW SEE PLUG-IN HYBRID MODELS HELP ADDRESS RANGE ANXIETY, REDUCE FUEL CONSUMPTION - Reuters STRONG INTERNALS FROM APOLLO TYRES HEADLINE NUMBERS MISS, BUT KEY EUROPE BUSINESS BEATS ESTIMATES EUROPE BUSINESS OUTPERFORMS\u00a0 KEY POSITIVE TAILWINDS - CORRECTION IN RUBBER PRICES FROM RECENT TOP AXIS CAP Europe revenue was up 6% YoY to Rs 19.3 bn, largely in line with our estimate of Rs 19 bn.

Track live updates  V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. \u201cDuring a correction phase in the market, like the present one, there will always be counter moves, which will facilitate a bounce back. This can happen any time now. The huge liquidity at the disposal of the DIIs can trigger this bounce back. But such a bounce back is unlikely to sustain since the fundamental factors are unfavourable. The Trump factor has triggered many profound changes in markets already. The dollar index is strong and rising and is currently at 106.61. The US 10-year bond yield is at 4.48%. These two are strong headwinds for equity markets in emerging economies like India. The positive factor is the huge liquidity at the disposal of the DIIs and the sustained flows into these funds. Domestically, the worry is the disappointing Q2 results and the consensus earnings downgrade. How long can these flows sustain? How early can we expect a rebound in earnings growth and strong GDP indications? These are relevant questions for which we will have to wait for answers. Meanwhile investors will have to stay with quality stocks in sectors with strong demand.\u201d Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research at HDFC Securities The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended Wednesday\u2019s session near the flatline as the postelection rally lost some steam. Stocks wavered as speculation the market has run too far after the US election offset bets the Federal Reserve will keep cutting rates. Trump won the Republican Trifecta as GOP Retains House Majority. The U.S. deficit spiked to start the new fiscal year, casting a shadow over the budget outlook as Washington braces for a second Trump presidency. The Treasury Department said that the federal budget deficit in October was about $257 billion, up 287% or $191 billion from a year earlier. Economists polled by FactSet had estimated the deficit would come in at $72.7 billion for October, the first month of fiscal 2025. The deficit was the highest for the first month of a fiscal year since the pandemic, in 2020. US CPI came in line with expectations, accelerating slightly to an annual inflation rate of 2.6%. Core CPI, which straps out volatile food and energy prices, gained 3.3% last month, also matching expectations. Traders upped odds for a quarter percentage point reduction to about 82%, according to the CME Group\u2019s FedWatch gauge. A day earlier, the market-implied probability was at just 59%. The U.S. dollar revisited a one-year high (106.55) against major peers on Thursday, as a fourth straight winning session from momentum sparked by Donald Trump\u2019s election victory eclipsed a rise in bets for Federal Reserve easing. Cryptocurrency bitcoin also shot to a fresh record high of $93,480 overnight, and was rising back towards that level early in Asia\u2019s day. Asia-Pacific markets were mostly down on Thursday after the U.S. October consumer price index reading fueled expectations for the Fed to cut rates again in December.

Swiggy has shown impressive growth potential, yet persistent losses over recent fiscal years signal challenges ahead. Investors may need to brace for a dynamic journey as the company seeks to balance expansion with sustainable financial performance. Central government and aggregate state government capex (20 major states) contracted by 15.4% and 10.5% (YoY) respectively in H1 FY25 impacted by the election-related restrictions in Q1.\u00a0 In H1 FY25, Centre and states have achieved only 37% and 28% of the full-year budgeted capex target.\u00a0 On the corporate capex front, the aggregate capex of 1,074 non-financial listed companies was seen at Rs 9.4 trillion in FY24, marginally lower than the previous year. Top 5 sectors of private capex in FY24: oil & petrochemicals (21% share), power (12.8%), telecom (12.8%), automobile and ancillaries (7.4%) and iron and steel (7.1%).\u00a0 Order books of a sample of capital goods companies increased by 10.3% in H1 FY25 compared to end FY24, reflective of healthy order book momentum.\u00a0 Order books of a sample of infrastructure companies (particularly involved in road development) saw substantial new orders with a 20.5% growth in H1 FY25 compared to end of FY24. Capex in power generation sector (listed & unlisted companies) is projected to grow at 13% CAGR between FY25 to FY28.\u00a0 Deleveraged corporate balance sheets and optimistic order book scenario (of capital goods & infra sector) bode well for the pick-up in capex going forward.\u00a0 However, challenges persistent in the form of weak domestic demand, geopolitical uncertainties, and external challenges  -- Emkay Global Research\u00a0 H1FY25\u2019s fiscal situation of both Centre and states has not been too concerning vs their budgeted path, with the Centre poised to possibly, even mildly, overachieve vs FY25BE. However, fiscal comfort in H1 has come more from curtailed federal spending with Centre\/states only achieving 46%\/41% of their revex and 37%\/28% of their capex targets. This has impacted 1H GDP growth owing to lower fiscal impulse vs last year, implying much higher govt spending (~21% YoY) in 2H, if they intend to match FY25BE spending. General government capex and revex is likely to see ~43% and ~18% growth vs -12% and 7%, respectively, in 1H. However, populism-led spending in states, and limited levers to mobilize revenues will make a case for mild fiscal slippage, with capex being a casualty, where we see states achieving a mere 75-80% of their budgeted capex vs 90% FY24P. We expect C+S capex to fall to 4.9% vs 5.4% FY25BE and 5.1% FY24P, even as the Centre may largely achieve its budgeted capex (ex-capex loans). Despite the expected federal spending ramp-up in H2, FY25E GDP growth is maintained at 6.5% due to multiple headwinds.

Titus Koshy, CEO of United Consultancy Services Group which has more than 150 employees, told Business Insider that the toxic smog engulfing the city had made it difficult for his staff to come into the office. \"There's so much confusion. People can't reach the office, public transport is not accessible, it's very disruptive and we've had to work from home,\" he said. Koshy added that some of his employees had complained about sore throats and viral infections over the past few weeks. On Monday, the Air Quality Index in New Delhi was over 1,500, the BBC said, or 15 times the level the World Health Organization (WHO) deems satisfactory for breathing. According to IQ Air, it improved to 186 on Thursday, a level still classed as \"unhealthy.\" The United States Environmental Protection Agency considers anything over 300 as \"hazardous\" to health. On Tuesday, Delhi's Chief Minister announced on X that schools would be shut and classes would be shifting online. Construction has also been banned in the city and some flights have been disrupted. \"These construction laborers are not going to be paid by anybody,\" said Koshy. \"They didn't even let someone come in and install a geyser in my house. These workers will be impacted more than anyone else, what do they do?\" Delhi and the surrounding areas are home to offices of several multinational companies, including JP Morgan, KPMG, Cisco, and Mondel\u0113z International. Shubham Gupta, a consultant at KPMG, told BI that he tries to work from home as much as possible, but his company mandates in-office work at least two to three days a week. He wears an N-95 mask on those days, and relies on the office air purifier. \"Sometimes it hits my mind that I should leave Delhi, but after all, our livelihood is there, so how can we leave?\" he said. KPMG India said its teams can exercise the flexibility for remote working in consultation with their managers and based on their client commitments. \"All have been advised to travel to\/from NCR\/Delhi only if it's business critical,\" a spokesperson said in a statement. \"Employee well-being continues to be our topmost priority and we will adapt ourselves as the situation evolves.\" Smog in the city is worse during the post-monsoon winter months, especially when it is combined with the annual Diwali festival, dust storms, and mass burning of crop residue from neighboring states. A 2019 study by the World Bank estimated the global cost of health damages associated with exposure to air pollution to be $8.1 trillion.

Morgan, in order to kill three prominent businessmen who opposed the formation of the Federal Reserve.","url":"https:\/\/www.snopes.com\/\/fact-check\/titanic-jp-morgan\/","published_at":"2024-11-19T03:00:00Z","content":"About this rating \n\n An online rumor claims the sinking of the Titanic was an inside job. According to the claim, American financier J.P. Morgan orchestrated the sinking of the Titanic in order to kill three prominent businessmen who opposed the formation of the Federal Reserve. For example, on Nov. 13, 2024, a user on X posted (archived), \"J.P. Morgan funded the building of the Titanic, and cancelled his long-awaited journey just hours before its proposed departure. 3 of the wealthiest men on earth, whom were against the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank happened to be invited aboard for its maiden voyage.\" Also, for a number of years prior to 2024, users shared on social media websites a meme reading (archived), \"Benjamin Guggenheim, Isidor Straus, [and John] Jacob Astor [all] opposed the new Federal Reserve bank. Today, these men would be worth $11 billion. All three of these men were aboard the Titanic when it sank. All three died that night.\" It's true that American businessman Benjamin Guggenheim, Macy's co-owner Isidor Straus, and fur magnate and real estate developer John Jacob Astor all perished in the sinking of the Titanic. However, the overall claim intimated by the meme was nothing more than a baseless conspiracy theory. The misleading meme was born out of previous ones mentioning Morgan, who owned the companies that managed the Titanic and was not a passenger on its maiden voyage. Past memes suggested that Morgan had somehow miraculously orchestrated the voyage to end in tragedy in order to kill Guggenheim, Straus and Astor. \"J.P. Morgan striking photographer with cane.\" (Courtesy: Library of Congress) According to the memes, Morgan's supposed reason for planning the demise of the three prominent men was because they all opposed the formation of the Federal Reserve \u2014\u00a0the centralized banking system established in 1913, the year after the sinking of the Titanic. The meme also said, \"Today, these men would be worth $11 billion.\" However, it's unclear how much each of the men's descendants would be worth today had they survived. In March 2021, Reuters published a thorough report that debunked the rumor behind all of the memes on this subject. The article included an interview with Titanic expert George Behe, whose research into the history of the Titanic goes back to the 1970s. According to Behe, there is no known evidence that showed Guggenheim, Straus or Astor opposed the formation of the Federal Reserve. In fact, in 1911, The New York Times reported that Astor was very much in favor of the idea. The reporting from Reuters said experts widely agree that the sinking of the Titanic was an accident. The ship struck an iceberg on the night of April 14, 1912. Within hours, more than 1,500 people had died. As for Morgan purportedly deciding to skip the voyage hours before departure, the Reuters story documented thoughts from three different historians: \"I've never been able to find an authoritative 1912 source explaining the exact reason why J.P. Morgan cancelled his passage on the Titanic, but he definitely didn't do so mere 'hours' before the ship's departure,\" Titanic expert George Behe said in an email to Reuters. Meanwhile, Don Lynch, a historian at the Titanic Historical Society (THS), said: \"One of J.P. Morgan's biographers said that France was changing its laws to prevent Americans from exporting art treasures from that country, so Morgan went to Paris to oversee getting his purchases out of the country before the new laws went into effect.\" Also from THS, advisory board member Ray Lepien, said that as well as the art treasures theory, \"the 'official' explanation was that he (Morgan) fell ill and wanted to take the 'cure' at a spa in France with his mistress.\" Lepien added: \"It could have been both reasons.\" We contacted Behe in an effort to find out if there had been any updates since Reuters published its story in 2021. \"To the best of my knowledge, the conspiracy theory is just as false today as it was when it was first created, and no important new revelations have turned up within the last couple of years,\" Behe told Snopes in an email dated Jan. 8, 2023. \"Sadly, once these nonsensical conspiracy theories have been foisted upon the general public via the internet, the theories are destined to plague humanity forevermore and will continue to fool innocent people who are unfamiliar with the facts.\" For further details, Behe pointed us in the direction of historian J. Kent Layton, who authored books including \"Conspiracies at Sea: Titanic and Lusitania,\" \"On a Sea of Glass: The Life & Loss of the RMS Titanic\" and \"Recreating Titanic & Her Sisters: A Visual History.\" \"We've been tackling this nonsense with historical data since at least the late-90s to early-00s,\" Layton told Snopes by email in June 2023. \"However, social media is a fantastic breeding ground for conspiracies of all sorts.\u00a0Titanic\u00a0seems to be a favorite of many.\" Layton remarked to us in detail regarding why the conspiracy theory made no sense to him: I would point out that if the sinking had actually been a conspiracy to kill those three individuals, there would have been no way that they could ensure their actual demise unless they had locked them somewhere inside the ship to die as it sank. Instead, the evidence indicates that all three were seen during the sinking. Guggenheim famously cast aside his heavy coat and lifebelt after his steward had helped him into them, saying that he and his manservant were \"dressed in their best and prepared to go down as gentlemen.\" Straus nearly made it into a lifeboat, and fellow passengers even recommended that he board a lifeboat with his wife, but he deferred, preferring to let women and children board while he waited behind with other men. Astor was seen very late in the disaster, helping his wife into a lifeboat; when he asked an officer loading the boat, apparently Second Officer Lightoller, if he could board, Lightoller said no. However, Lightoller had maintained a rather rigid policy of allowing no men into the lifeboats that he filled, and there had been plenty of other opportunities for Astor to board a boat. In fact, we recently discovered an account that indicated that Astor and his wife had approached an early boat on the other side of the ship, when the situation seemed less serious, but that they had stepped back from the lifeboat of their own accord at the last moment and stayed for a while longer on the ship. If a conspiracy to kill these three men had been so deep and involved so as to actually sink an ocean liner and kill hundreds of innocent people, one would think that the individuals responsible would not have left the survival of these three men to chance. This story will be updated in the future should we uncover any further helpful information.\u00a0 Beattie, Andrew, et al. \"How the Federal Reserve Was Formed.\" Investopedia, 24 June 2007, https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/economics\/08\/federal-reserve.asp.

The streamer will release several movies and TV shows that will undoubtedly wind up on the streamer's most popular lists. On December 26, Squid Game, Netflix's most-watched show, returns for its deadly second season. Plus, Taron Egerton will play a TSA agent out to save his airport from a terrorist in a new Netflix action movie, Carry-On. Netflix's biggest strength is its vault. If\u00a0Squid Game\u00a0or\u00a0Carry-On\u00a0are of no interest to you, then keep searching the service for something that fits your needs. If you feel like taking a chance, try one of these underrated movies. Our picks include an entertaining thriller, a Fast & Furious sequel, and a holiday romance. After you have finished diving into all the holiday movies you can stomach and the shows coming out this month, it\u2019s time to look back at a classic rom-com or two. They are perfect when you want to shut your brain off for a couple of hours and get lost in a totally fictional story of two people meeting and eventually falling in love. Of course, it\u2019s the journey between these points checkered with humorous moments that make rom-coms so darn delightful. You\u2019ll find a good selection of rom-coms on all the best streaming services, and these three rom-coms on Amazon Prime Video you need to watch in December are a good place to start. One is even holiday-themed so you can stick with the festive spirit. Have you defied gravity yet? If not, you're one of the few who haven't. Wicked\u00a0is a genuine phenomenon right now, and one of the leading contenders for next year's Oscars. But I haven't taken a trip to Oz yet simply because there's too much good stuff on streaming right now. That's especially true for Max, which has great films from the present to the distant past. (Yes, they even have 1939's The Wizard of Oz.) If you have a craving for movies that don't contain evil witches, pink-colored princesses, or flying monkeys, well, this list is for you. These movies may have Nazis, porn stars, and real-life artists, but they are all united by their ability to entertain and even enlighten.

Banks are howling. They may have a point.","url":"https:\/\/www.nakedcapitalism.com\/2024\/11\/wall-street-banks-accused-of-trying-to-sabotage-key-consumer-protection-rule.html","published_at":"2024-11-16T08:58:25Z","content":"Yves here. As much as banks do try to increase the cost to customers of switching banks, depending on what the Consumer Financial Protection proposed rule about requiring a bank to \u201cunlock\u201d a departing customer\u2019s financial data and transferring it to the new bank amounts to, the banks may have a very legitimate beef. I do not know how many customers find access to historical records to be important. I have to assume small business customers do since payment records are almost certainly needed in the event of an IRS audit. Yes, you can retain them locally, but I prefer having the security of knowing I can get them from the bank if needed. Merely from my dealing with three banks (Citi, TD and PNC), it is clear they retain historical information in very different formats. For instance, in my Citi small business account, which has an entirely different (more stringent) login process than their consumer accounts, I have been stymied in locating images of cancelled checks (Citi is very anti-check, this may be part of their effort to discourage use). TD by contrast links small business to consumer accounts of the owner. They also includes check images in monthly statements for a fee; otherwise, if you want TD to run them down later, the past and perhaps still current practice is for TD to run them down for a fee. PNC does not include them with statements, evah; you can download images painfully, check number by check number, from the bank website. Similarly, TD only allows downloading of transaction data in a CSV format for a very limited time, as in the past two months, while Citi does not seem to impose time limits. So if any of these banks were to export their data to a recipient bank, the odds that it could affordably made it accessible to new customers seems like a fantasy. However, to support the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus\u2019s beef, many (I assume all) banks wipe historical data when you close an account. I apologize for not running down the fine points on this debate. Knowledgeable readers are encouraged to fill in the gaps. By Julia Conley, staff writer at Common Dreams. Originally published at Common Dreams Consumer advocates applauded last month as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized a rule aimed at making it easier for people to switch financial institutions if they\u2019re unhappy with a bank\u2019s service, without the bank retaining their personal data\u2014but on Thursday, more than a dozen groups warned the CFPB that major Wall Street firms are trying to stop Americans from benefiting from the rule. Several advocacy groups, led by the Demand Progress Education Fund, wrote to CFPB director Rohit Chopra warning that major banks\u2014including JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citi, TD Bank, and Wells Fargo\u2014sit on the board of the Financial Data Exchange (FDX), which has applied to the bureau for standard-setting body (SSB) status, which would give it authority over what is commonly known as the \u201copen banking rule.\u201d Standard-setting authority for the banks would present a major conflict of interest, said the groups. The banks are also on the board of the Bank Policy Institute, which promptly filed what the consumer advocates called a \u201cfrivolous lawsuit\u201d to block the open banking rule when it was introduced last month, claiming it will keep banks from protecting customer data. At a panel discussion this week, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan also said the open banking rule, by requiring financial firms to unlock a consumer\u2019s financial data and transfer it to another provider for free, would cause \u201cchaos\u201d and amplify concerns over fraud. The groups wrote on Thursday that big banks want to continue to \u201cmaintain their dominance by making it unduly difficult for consumers to switch institutions.\u201d \u201cThe presence of these organizations on both the FDX and BPI boards undermines the credibility of FDX and presents various concerns relating to conflict of interest, interlocking directorate, and antitrust law,\u201d they wrote. Upon introducing the finalized rule last month, Chopra said the action would \u201cgive people more power to get better rates and service on bank accounts, credit cards, and more\u201d and help those who are \u201cstuck in financial products with lousy rates and service.\u201d The coalition of consumer advocacy groups\u2014including Public Citizen, the American Economic Liberties Project, and Americans for Financial Reform\u2014urged Chopra to reject FDX\u2019s application for standard-setting authority so long as the banks remain on its board. \u201cIt would be a flagrant conflict of interest for the same banks who are suing to block the open banking rule because it threatens their market dominance to also be in charge of implementing it,\u201d said Demand Progress Education Fund corporate power director Emily Peterson-Cassin. \u201cThe American people are fed up with Wall Street controlling every aspect of their lives and the open banking rule is an opportunity to give all of us some financial freedom. The CFPB must stop this ploy by the biggest banks to keep us trapped under their thumbs.\u201d The groups called the open banking rule \u201ca historic step forward for the cause of giving consumers true freedom intheir financial lives.\u201d \u201cFor this reason, it is imperative that SSB status not be granted to an organization whose board members are, either directly or through a trade association they are participating in, suing the CFPB to stop the rules from taking effect, particularly when such members may be ethically conflicted from such dual participation,\u201d said the groups. \u201cBy rejecting SSB status for FDX or any other organization with similar conflicts of interest pertaining to Section 1033, the CFPB will help prevent big banks from sabotaging open banking rules.\u201d SO proving it is important to keep an electronic copy of all bank statements. I used to keep paper but no longer \u2013 all have gone on the burn pile!  Having finally fired B of A after a 25 yr relationship in favor of a local Credit Union, so nice to go into a branch and talk with another member. AND \u2013 credit unions share ATM\u2019s nation-wide, no fees, so you can access funds anywhere. B of A had coverage gaps, notably in New England, necessitating opening another account just for New England. CU\u2019s are both local, and through collective agreements, national as well. Perhaps a good model for a federation? SOrt of like we sued to have prior to the Wilson administration\u2019s corrupt and war- and global bank-serving actions \u2013 federal reserve bank, espionage act, entry into foreign wars with no clear US interest, suppression of free speech, jailing of political enemies \u2013 interestingly, repeated by our current Dem administration all. How is it that Dem administrations are responsible for all the wars of the last 125 years (except Iraq, but of course now JWB is an honorary Dem along with Liz Cheney). And it was under the FDR administration that probably the most evil acts of prohibition were enacted \u2013 alcohol prohibition, and cannabis prohibition.  How is it that the Dems are so revered when they have done so much evil to the citizens of the US of A and to the world in general? Not entirely sure how I got here from banking but nonetheless, I have to repeat, the Dem party is pure filth. Especially in its current incarnation. Divadab.  Wilson (Dem) vetoed the Volsted Act (Prohibition) in 1919.  But Congress over rode the veto. FDR repealed Prohibition.  He was a Dem.    Reagan Repubs started the whole \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d thing. divadab: if dems are pure evil, why did Biden appoint Lina Khan to FCC? Conversely, if Trump is pure evil, why did he kill TPP? Both actions are citizen friendly, big business unfriendly. Politics is shaded.  it was under the FDR administration that probably the most evil acts of prohibition were enacted \u2013 alcohol prohibition, and cannabis prohibition. \u2013 divadab This is simply wrong. Alcohol prohibition was the result of the 19th ammendment, passed in 1919. Roosevelt ended prohibition in 1933. It is true that cannabis prohibitioon was criminalized at the Federal level in 1937, but by 1931 marijana was already illegal in 29 states. Google is your friend, unless you have an agenda. Alcohol prohibition is a very old issue, going back to the 1820s.  Mostly a state issue which became an important party platform issue as a differentiator.  Federal prohibition is really just an episode in the larger scheme. I have notice  in my  bank statements now bank can see what i buy. I have a feeling they will sell these data to who knows, is there no limit to these people greed. EU even pass new law where bank can close easily your account. I have a feeling they did it for Russians citizens or people who are pro Russians Electronic banking in the \u201cinformation\u201d age? Here in Hawaii, there is no demand for \u201cmainland\u201d banks.  Our largest, First Hawaiian (started by the husband of Hawaiian royal Princess Bernice Pauahi) was bought out by what eventually was foreign bank but kept local systems and eventually was spun back out as an independent entity.  BofA tried to get into the market by buying Honolulu Fed S&L during the S&L crisis but threw in the towel and sold the branches\/accounts to American Savings (owned by local utility). But in general, I find getting copies of check images is a chore (we use two banks and a credit union).  Other than that all data is in Quicken  (some going back to 1978) so I\u2019m not really dependent on historical data unless I need \u201cofficial\u201d statements. When my father got too old to keep it up I helped him shut down his small business, and my experience is trying to close small business accounts at Chase is the hardest financial thing I have ever done (next to dealing with crappy home loan servicers like Wells Fargo or WaMu). I\u2019m not sure what data exchange the \u201copen banking\u201d effort is designed to apply to.  Does anyone have a link to a summary of the details? If we\u2019re talking about things like: list of online payees, check history, credit card history, etc.  This seems designed to appeal to upper middle class people (like me).  I don\u2019t see how this ability to exchange data helps any working class people actually get a better deal on their bank services.  It seems like \u201cregulation theater\u201d to me. Stockman Bank out of Miles City, Montanny offers \u2018free\u2019 over-50 checking and paper statements via mail (Pony Express!)  include check images.\nIf something is Free, you are the commodity, not sure how they are monetizing my non-glamorous\nnominal consumer life.\nOn line banking forces pass-word changes monthly, I dumped out on it years ago.\nA gal I was helping with a Mortgage declined my attempts to cross-sell her on line banking products (Wells Fargo!). She worked in mergers and acquisitions for Cisco, and said, \u201cI will NEVER  transact on-line.\u201d\nThat was enough for me. Not transacting on line at all is difficult. Risk on a pc can be minimized by using a browser just for financial accounts. I will never put finance related stuff on my phone, including the built in wallet. Far too risky. Won\u2019t get a debit card either. Banks don\u2019t delete your data when you close an account. Under the new consumer law you can request they do (they still keep some data as required by the federal government). I made this request when Wells Fargo, for the second time since I closed my account in 2009, opened an account in my name. No one ever took credit or provided info on how it happened. But they did report deleting me after I requested. PNC says very clearly they do delete your transaction records when you close an account, which is what most consumers and business people value. The data they are required to retain is of the account holder, which I assume is things like your SSN, your address and phone number when you had your account, whether this was a solely-owned or joint account, perhaps the types of accounts you had.  I don\u2019t see this as very useful for customers to ask their banks to provide to them. Can\u2019t speak to other FIs\u2019 practice, but mine as a matter of policy retains statements for 7 years irrespective of whether the account is open or closed (and we don\u2019t even remove access to the online platform for closed accounts, a practice I have loudly complained about for years as a big security risk, to no avail). I have always assumed this is a regulatory requirement, but record retention isn\u2019t exactly in my wheelhouse. Judging by your description of other FI policies, I might\u2019ve been off the mark on that assumption.

The FCA said in October 2023 that it intended to ban Staley from senior roles and fine him 1.8 million pounds ($2.27 million) in relation to a letter sent by Barclays to the financial watchdog in 2019. Staley said then that he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d with the FCA decision, which he is now challenging. His appeal is due to be heard by London\u2019s Upper Tribunal in March next year. The watchdog found Staley, a former JP Morgan executive, had \u201crecklessly approved\u201d the letter, which the FCA said contained two misleading statements, about his relationship with Epstein and their last contact. In documents for a preliminary hearing on Monday, the FCA said that Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, who was FCA chief executive between 2016 and 2020, and Barclays chairman Nigel Higgins had both given witness statements for the case. The FCA also argued in court on Monday that material from a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Virgin Islands against JP Morgan suggested Staley had misled the FCA in interviews and in his response to the tribunal case. Staley\u2019s lawyers said that the FCA is attempting to present an entirely new case and allowing the British regulator to amend its case would be unfair. Last year, JP Morgan agreed to pay $75 million to settle the U.S. Virgin Islands\u2019 claim that the bank aided in Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking. It also reached a confidential settlement with Staley, who JP Morgan blamed for keeping him as a client. Epstein killed himself in a New York jail in 2019, while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. The FCA\u2019s lawyer Leigh-Ann Mulcahy said in court documents that, based on evidence given in the U.S. lawsuit, Staley had \u201cdishonestly or recklessly\u201d misled the watchdog in three interviews between 2019 and 2021. Staley told the FCA that \u201cI\u2019d had zero contact, any relationship at all, with Jeffrey\u201d while he was at Barclays, where he was chief executive from December 2015 until 2021. Judge Tim Herrington will give his ruling on whether the FCA can amend its case at a later date. (Reporting by Sam Tobin; Editing by Alexander Smith) Was this article valuable? Thank you!

Why? \u201cBecause then that country has to conform its military purchases to NATO weapon specifications which means certain companies \u2026 get a trapped market,\u201d he explained. Who Really Profits from the Ukraine War? By\u00a0Wisdom Land, 2 September 2024 Few people understand what the war in Ukraine means for big business \u2013 namely, opportunity. It\u2019s not just the weapons and reconstruction contracts. Ukraine\u2019s vast agricultural lands- \u00a0among the most fertile in the world \u2013 are up for grabs, and American companies like BlackRock are at the front of the line.\u00a0 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (\u201cRFK Jr.\u201d) deftly and clearly explains. [You can find a copy of the video above published by RFK Jr. on YouTube HERE and a write-up published by Indian news outlet Times Now World\u00a0HERE.] JP Morgan and BlackRock, along with consultancy McKinsey & Company, are collaborating with the Ukrainian government to establish a reconstruction fund. The objective of this fund is to attract significant investments for the country\u2019s reconstruction, which could cost between $400 billion and $1 trillion, depending on estimates. This fund, known as the Fund for the Development of Ukraine, will use a \u201cblended finance\u201d approach to mobilize both public and private capital, targeting priority sectors such as infrastructure, climate, and agriculture. BlackRock and JP Morgan offered their services pro bono to manage this fund, leveraging their expertise in financial markets and debt management. The intention is that this fund can begin to operate fully once the war ends, although planning is already underway and has been discussed at recent international conferences. The recent partnership between JP Morgan, BlackRock, and McKinsey & Company to rebuild Ukraine highlights the bitter irony of the current geopolitical situation. In a deal that aims to raise hundreds of billions of dollars for the reconstruction of war-torn Ukraine, these American financial giants now position themselves as the economic saviors of a country whose destruction, in part, was facilitated by policies and actions in financial markets that they themselves dominated and shaped. The United States, through its foreign policies and interventions, has a long history of fomenting instability in various regions of the world. In the case of Ukraine, the situation is no different. From the beginning of the Ukrainian crisis, American interests were clear: to weaken Russia and expand the Western sphere of influence. The irony becomes even more evident when we consider that many of the same financial institutions now being called upon to rebuild Ukraine are those that have profited immensely from armed conflicts and the destabilization of global markets. JP Morgan and BlackRock are entities deeply rooted in the global financial system, and both have a history of financing military industries and governments that perpetuate conflict. JP Morgan, for example, has a long history of involvement in financing wars and authoritarian regimes around the world. BlackRock, in turn, as the largest asset manager in the world, has stakes in practically all major defense companies, which profit directly from the manufacture of weapons used in conflicts such as Ukraine. This dichotomy is alarming: the same institutions that financed destruction are now celebrated as leaders of reconstruction. The \u201cfund of reconstruction\u201d proposed for Ukraine is not just a humanitarian effort; it is also a strategic maneuver to ensure that Western capital has control over the country\u2019s future assets and economic infrastructure. The reconstruction of Ukraine, costing up to a trillion dollars, presents a lucrative opportunity for these companies, which are now seen as saviors. Furthermore, McKinsey & Company\u2019s presence on the project adds an additional layer of criticism, as the consulting firm has frequently been accused of unethical practices and collusion with corrupt regimes. McKinsey\u2019s lack of transparency and controversial practices call into question the integrity of the reconstruction process.

Founded as a B-Corp, NationSwell is a force for social, economic, and environmental progress. Its mission? To empower impact leaders across sectors with the community, support, and capabilities they need to accelerate their work and drive systemic change. Greg Behrman, CEO of NationSwell, recently sat down with me and shared the organization\u2019s purpose and vision and how it tackles some of today\u2019s most pressing challenges through collaboration and innovation. \u201cWe\u2019re a B-Corp that draws inspiration from impact leaders who are driving progress and working to build the future we need. We built a company to be in deep service to those leaders. Our mission at NationSwell is to provide the expert community and the essential support those leaders need to lead at their best.\u201d NationSwell\u2019s vision, he added, is to be \u201cthe world\u2019s leading partner powering a thriving social impact ecosystem: supporting the community of cross-sector partners working together to make the world more fair, just and prosperous for everyone.\u201d A Diverse, Cross-Sector Community NationSwell\u2019s community is intentionally curated, comprising around 150 leading companies, investment firms, financial institutions, private foundations, nonprofits, and individual visionary and community-based leaders, who were invited to join the membership community and with whom NationSwell actively partners. This diverse membership spans industries and sectors, creating a vibrant, collaborative network. \u201cWe\u2019ve sought to curate the community with authentic and committed leaders doing inspired work \u2013 and have intentionally designed the community to cut across industries and sectors,\u201d Behrman explained. \u201cSo often impact leaders know the person in their role in their space. NationSwell helps to open the aperture,\u201d he added. The goal is to foster cross-sector collaboration and partnerships that spark innovation and drive systemic change. NationSwell\u2019s unique model focuses on deep, impact-driven, and human-centered engagement, offering members a range of services including insights and best practices; catalytic connections and relationship development; intimate and actionable conversations and experiences; and award-winning strategic consulting, thought leadership, and creative storytelling. \u201cOur members are busy. A lot is coming at them, and a lot is demanded of them. They are also service-minded and always thinking of how best to support others,\u201d Behrman noted. \u201cOur nimble, personalized model enables us to be the partner that is there to serve them. They deserve it.\u201d Greg Behrman, CEO of NationSwell Supporting Leaders in Turbulent Times The current landscape is rife with uncertainty, and NationSwell is stepping up to help its members navigate these challenges. Behrman described how the organization is providing vital insights, resources, and connections to help leaders stay effective and inspired. \u201cWe are helping our members and partners to navigate uncertainty and turbulence by ensuring they have exposure to what others are doing and thinking, and line of sight into what\u2019s working best,\u201d says Behrman. Through curated conversations with peer leaders and visionaries, NationSwell fosters collaboration and shared learning. Additionally, they\u2019re focusing on supporting leaders; and broader impact teams, recognizing the critical role of the emerging leaders in shaping the future of the field. Driving Collective Action Through Collaboratives A cornerstone of NationSwell\u2019s work is its Collaboratives\u2014intensive programs that unite funders, experts, and practitioners to tackle systemic challenges. These initiatives are designed to facilitate shared action, providing the structure and expertise necessary for impactful collaboration. \u201cOur Collaboratives are designed and optimized to provide a range of support. Through Collaboratives we bring together incredible groups of funders, experts, practitioners, and community-based leaders \u2014 taking them on a shared action journey designed to help them learn, connect, elevate their work and grantees; refine their strategies and efforts; and identify opportunities for co-investment and shared action,\u201d Behrman explained. Recent efforts include programs like Case for Childcare and Place-Based Impact, both of which recently earned Anthem Awards. Those Collaboratives were launched in partnership with organizations like Pivotal Ventures, Annie E. Casey Foundation, BlackRock Foundation, Starbucks, Mass Mutual, Cisco, KPMG, and American Family Insurance. At Climate Week this year, they launched a new Collaborative on Clear Air in partnership with Coupa. This week, they are launching a new Collaborative on Collective Wealth Building, developed in partnership with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Travelers, and other key funders to address wealth disparities and promote community prosperity. Behrman highlighted the value these Collaboratives bring: \u201cEach Collaborative also produces one-of-a-kind resources that fill a gap and help advance the field.\u201d A cornerstone of NationSwell\u2019s work is its Collaboratives\u2014intensive programs that unite funders, ... [+] experts, and practitioners to tackle systemic challenges. Pioneering Partnerships and Initiatives NationSwell\u2019s impact extends far beyond its Collaboratives. Behrman highlighted several key initiatives, such as a partnership with Johnson & Johnson to advance health equity and a collaboration with Omidyar Network to explore responsible uses of AI. In the workforce development space, NationSwell is currently partnering with JP Morgan Chase - and a range of other leading local stake-holders - to design a system-wide strategy in Columbus, Ohio. It also partnered with Stacey Abrams, her sister Andrea, and the team at American Pride Rises to support DEI initiatives. On the democracy and civic engagement front, NationSwell produced Civics Inc., a report that explores how companies can activate their employees and communities. This report, developed with Patagonia, recently won an Anthem Award and was highlighted in a Fortune article co-authored with Patagonia CEO Ryan Gellert. Advice for Purpose-Driven Leaders Behrman\u2019s advice for leaders navigating today\u2019s complex landscape? Three things. Stay deeply anchored in core values and deepest beliefs, remain curious and open to listening, and recognize the vital role of impact leaders. \u201cTheir vision, voices, and values will light the way forward,\u201d he emphasized. NationSwell\u2019s work is a testament to the power of collaboration and the potential for purposeful leadership to drive meaningful change. As Behrman put it, \u201cI believe impact leaders will do their best and most important work in the years ahead. That provides me with purpose and hope.\u201d  One Community.

Why are minor infractions creating major career challenges?","url":"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/chriswestfall\/2024\/11\/18\/from-small-sins-to-privilege-abuse-companies-introduce-sneaky-layoffs\/","published_at":"2024-11-18T22:50:19Z","content":"Are you really going to go there? Big-name companies are letting employees go for small reasons. \u201c Sneaky layoffs\u201d are when companies use simple policy violations as the basis for career-altering decisions. From time to time, everyone breaks a company policy at work. However, some employers are cracking down on enforcement - using minor infractions as a reason for dismissal. Firing employees for abuse of privilege or \u201csmall sins\u201d is a growing trend, pointing towards what some are calling sneaky layoffs. For example, EY - the accounting and consulting firm with nearly 400,000 employees worldwide - dismissed workers who were caught watching multiple training videos at the same time. At Facebook parent Meta, employees were fired for spending a $25 meal allowance on non-food items. Considering that Meta is TikTok famous for providing headphones, mice and keyboards inside free vending machines, this policy seems out of character. Or is it? Matt Tedesco told the Daily Mail that he was let go from Tedesco, along with about a dozen colleagues, for buying groceries with meal stipends. While you may be wondering, \u201caren\u2019t groceries food?\u201d, Tedesco moved to another role at Hearst Media. He tells the Microsoft Network, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get a job right now - it took me months.\u201d His experience is a cautionary tale for those committing small sins around perks and privilege: \u201cFrom an employee standpoint, my takeaway is don\u2019t abuse any privilege because it\u2019s not worth the risk,\u201d he says. It seems the employee-employer power struggle is tilting in the company\u2019s favor, especially for those using strict enforcement to cut headcount. Companies are \u201ctrying to make an example of behavior they think is inappropriate,\u201d according to Jennifer Dulski in the Wall Street Journal. Dulski is CEO of Rising Team, an HR software company. She says that some companies are just weeding out the bad apples and over-hires. Many companies are still right-sizing after the post-pandemic hiring blitz. Simple violations can be the start of sneaky layoffs, giving bosses a reason to reduce headcount and payroll. At some employers, a small abuse of policy can be met with strict retribution - sending a message to fellow employees regarding what will and won\u2019t be tolerated. When it comes to making sure your career is secure, it\u2019s best not to bump up against company policy. Here are three ways to reduce risk, especially in a tight job market: In October, the US economy added just 12,000 jobs - the slowest growth since the pandemic, according to financial firm, JP Morgan. The US Chamber of Commerce says that there are still 8.2 million job openings nationwide, pointing to a widening labor shortage. So why the sneaky layoffs for small sins? Seems that some companies are looking for ways to reduce payroll, not add to it. Surprisingly, the National Federation of Independent Businesses says that 40% of business owners report job openings that they can not fill. \u201cSmall business owners are feeling more uncertain than ever. Uncertainty makes owners hesitant to invest in capital spending and inventory, especially as inflation and financing costs continue to put pressure on their bottom lines. Although some hope lies ahead in the holiday sales season, many Main Street owners are left questioning whether future business conditions will improve,\u201d according to NFIB Chief Economist, Bill Dunkelberg. In an uncertain labor market, it\u2019s a troubling time to be dismissed for small sins - and a privilege, it seems, to have a job.  One Community.

The Federal Reserve's rate cuts mean returns on cash will decline. Bond yields may fluctuate due to concerns over inflation and the deficit. And, the broad market could see muted gains, per an October note from Goldman Sachs that expects the S&P 500 to return a mere 3% annually for the next 10 years. This leaves little room for safe havens. In general, diversification has been a challenge for investors over the last couple of years as stocks and bonds moved in tandem to a degree we haven't seen in quite some time, says Jon Adams, CIO at Calamos Wealth Management. And that presents challenges for those who follow the traditional balance of 60% stocks to 40% bonds as a diversifier, he added. \"Momentum has really been driving equities higher across the board, especially with respect to large-cap growth names,\" Adams said. \"So, concentration has clearly been a concern for investors over the last few years.\" On the bond side, the biggest threat will be the implication of policy changes and how it will impact the Treasury market, says Jimmy Chang, the CIO of the Rockefeller Global Family Office. The 10-year yield spiked after President-elect Donald Trump won the election. Bond investors quickly discounted the risk of rising tariffs and tighter immigration policies, both of which could aggravate inflation and push yields even higher, Chang said, adding that long-duration bonds could be facing their own set of headwinds. That said, the risk-reward tradeoff \u2014 a measurement of potential profit versus loss\u2014 may become the real measure of diversification. But it won't be easy since it's one of the longest-standing ratios academics studying financial markets have grappled with: must risk increase with returns? It's not an obvious answer and hinges on a few latent factors, according to a recent study by Wharton's finance department. The study found that stocks, bonds, and options strategies could have more correlated risk than is evident on the surface. And that link could strengthen as you deploy certain variables across sectors to gain more upside. The latest version of the study, published June 2024, analyzed data from June 2004 to December 2021 with trading strategies built on signals such as momentum, beta, price behavior, and accounting variables using 35 characteristics for stocks, 26 for corporate bonds, and 19 for options to extract the factors that cause them to behave the same way. While many signals were difficult to detect manually, it found that one key culprit that increased systemic risk amid macroeconomic uncertainty across all three securities was bond duration, likely due to interest-rate sensitivity. More simply, if a portfolio has a high degree of exposure to long-duration corporate bonds, an investor may want to rethink their positions in interest rate-sensitive sectors in equities or options, and vice versa. Overall, seeking upside in corporate bonds offered little in terms of excess returns without increasing correlated risk that could be found across all three securities, noted Nikolai Roussanov, a professor of finance at the Wharton School. It makes sense, says David Kelly, chief global strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, who noted that the correlation would be higher between certain sectors within equities like growth stocks, which correlate more to long-duration bonds than value stocks because the former relies on future earnings and long-term interest rate changes. \"When you've got high long-term interest rates, the present value of all those far-flung cash flows, it gets just eaten up,\" Kelly said. \"So value stocks are about the here-and-now, growth stocks are about the hereafter.\" There are two ways out of this, Kelly noted. First, avoid putting all your eggs in the US basket of stocks and consider international equities. Investors tend to be underweight in the latter, he said, but there's no harm in adding them. He also suggests alternatives that could mimic fixed-income returns but aren't bonds. Examples include funds that invest in real estate, infrastructure, and transportation. Adams seconds the advice on alternatives, adding that public and private infrastructure investments, particularly those exposed to data center and power demand, have been part of their risk mitigation strategy, acting as a partial hedge against a higher rate or inflationary environment.

The FCA said in October 2023 that it intended to ban Staley from senior roles and fine him 1.8 million pounds ($2.27 million) in relation to a letter sent by  Barclays  (LON:BARC) to the financial watchdog in 2019. Staley said then that he was \"very disappointed\" with the FCA decision, which he is now challenging. His appeal is due to be heard by London's Upper Tribunal in March next year. The watchdog found Staley, a former JP Morgan executive, had \"recklessly approved\" the letter, which the FCA said contained two misleading statements, about his relationship with Epstein and their last contact. In documents for a preliminary hearing on Monday, the FCA said that Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, who was FCA chief executive between 2016 and 2020, and Barclays chairman Nigel Higgins had both given witness statements for the case. The FCA also argued in court on Monday that material from a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Virgin Islands against JP Morgan suggested Staley had misled the FCA in interviews and in his response to the tribunal case. Staley's lawyers said that the FCA is attempting to present an entirely new case and allowing the British regulator to amend its case would be unfair. Last year, JP Morgan agreed to pay $75 million to settle the U.S. Virgin Islands' claim that the bank aided in Epstein's sex trafficking. It also reached a confidential settlement with Staley, who JP Morgan blamed for keeping him as a client. Epstein killed himself in a New York jail in 2019, while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. The FCA's lawyer Leigh-Ann Mulcahy said in court documents that, based on evidence given in the U.S. lawsuit, Staley had \"dishonestly or recklessly\" misled the watchdog in three interviews between 2019 and 2021.  Staley told the FCA that \"I'd had zero contact, any relationship at all, with Jeffrey\" while he was at Barclays, where he was chief executive from December 2015 until 2021. Judge Tim Herrington will give his ruling on whether the FCA can amend its case at a later date."},{"source":"Yourmileagemayvary.com","author":"Your Mileage May Vary","title":"The Future of the Apple Card: Could Chase Be Its Next Home?","description":"It\u2019s hard to believe that nearly a year has passed since Apple and Goldman Sachs announced their plans to terminate their partnership for the Apple Card.

The European Central Bank warned on Wednesday that indices\u2019 increased dependence on a few mega-cap stocks \u201craises concerns over the possibility of an AI-related asset price bubble\u201d, but America\u2019s biggest bank is more sanguine in its 2025 outlook. Yes, the biggest stocks are doing the heavy lifting, with JPMorgan noting the so-called magnificent seven stocks now account for 35 per cent of the S&P 500, and 70 per cent of index returns since the beginning of 2023. Furthermore, the 10 largest stocks trade on 29 times estimated earnings, compared to 19 for the rest of the index \u2013 a valuation gap JPMorgan sees as \u201cunsustainable\u201d. If AI delivers on its promise, the broader market should eventually catch up; if AI\u2019s practical applications remain limited, a \u201ccatch-down\u201d correction is likely. However, strong fundamentals mean a big \u201ccatch-down\u201d is unlikely. The magnificent seven hold $460 billion on their balance sheets. Extremely low interest rates on Apple\u2019s corporate bonds maturing in 2032 reveal investors\u2019 faith. And unlike the late 1990s dotcom bubble, rising share prices are supported by earnings growth. Amazon shares are up 46 per cent over the last year but huge earnings growth means its price-earnings ratio has fallen from 48 to 35. Meta shares are up 78 per cent, but it still trades on just 24 times estimated earnings. Nvidia\u2019s surging share price has been accompanied by rocketing earnings.

Her time away changed her career priorities.","url":"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/quit-jp-morgan-career-gap-travel-wasting-life-2024-11","published_at":"2024-11-19T10:02:02Z","content":"This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ashley Tan, 29, who quit her job at JP Morgan Singapore to travel. It's been edited for length and clarity. I've always been a rule follower. After graduating from university, I went straight to work and took a role at JP Morgan for the company name. I was so used to following the rules and societal standards that I truly believed climbing the corporate ladder equated to success. However, I was unfulfilled. In March, I quit my job to travel. I've been exposed to so many new perspectives that I never really got coming from an Asian society. It has given me a huge mindset shift. I was hired by JP Morgan in December 2022 as an events and marketing analyst. It wasn't really a job I wanted, but because my parents and I think Singapore puts finance companies on a pedestal, I took it. It wasn't all bad, though. I liked that I was doing something completely different than my previous jobs, most of which were writing-focused. This was front-facing, helping with client events and conferences, which was great for me as a people person. However, I didn't feel like the company had much tolerance for my out-of-the-box ideas. My team and I were always pitching new ways to make events more exciting for clients, but we were shut down by higher-ups who ruled in favor of tradition and simplicity. I get it because it's a bank, but I found it frustrating to have to stick to the old ways of doing things and I didn't feel fulfilled because I knew I didn't want to pursue marketing long-term. I felt like I was wasting my life. I'd been wanting to take time off work to travel for several years, but I was scared because Singapore is a competitive society. Taking a career break is generally looked down upon or seen as a waste of time. Even so, I'd been putting aside a small portion of my income at JP Morgan for travel in case I could make it happen. About a year into my time at JP Morgan, I reached out to my cousin, who had previously taken a year off of work to travel. Hearing her experience made me feel like I could do it. I knew I'd rather be out exploring and meeting new people than stuck at a job I didn't like for the sake of the company name. I felt like it was now or never because I was approaching my 30s and knew I'd only gain more responsibilities as I aged. It was scary, but I officially quit JP Morgan in March because I knew I'd regret it if I didn't take the risk. I've been traveling for several months now, using my savings to fund it. My parents are quite traditional and conservative, so they were shocked when I told them I was unemployed and planning to travel. Life has been great since I quit. I went to Bali for two weeks to dive and surf, then spent a month traveling through Europe, visiting friends and family, and meeting new people along the way. However, after meeting travelers who are paving their own ways and prioritizing happiness, I realize it's up to me to make the life I want a reality. It's been an enlightening change. I'm planning to try DJing, which I've wanted to do for the longest time, but I strayed away from it because it's not seen as a sustainable job in my family's eyes. If I fail, at least I tried; if I succeed, it'll be a wonderful surprise. I've been applying to jobs while abroad, but I'm being very selective. I used to think any job was good as long as I was getting paid. You go in, do your work, and go home. Now I know I need to work for a company with bosses who are willing to listen, consider feedback, and grow. If I don't manage to find something in Singapore, I'm thinking of moving to Australia to do a working holiday visa or even starting my own business. I'll find some time for DJing as well. Concerned comments from friends and family have made me question my decision, and I don't know what's next for me, but I know I'm in the right place. Luckily, my experiences traveling outweigh being at an unfulfilling job.

No I am not one of those weirdos who over since sensationalize this; ultimately, I don\u2019t really care that much. What I am more interested is in, maybe the concept of digital property, digital property rights. What is also really fascinating is how bitcoin is global digital capital, digital rights for all all across the planet. For example, assuming that you live in mainland China and there is capital controls, what that then means is that you cannot take out $1 billion of Chinese yuan out of the country, even if you wanted to. Actually technically the smart strategy for rich me and Chinese person who wants to come to America whatever, is to swap all of their Chinese yuan or whatever for bitcoin, as much as humanly possible, and then just peace out. The reason why this would be such a good strategy is that the truth is, nobody wants their wealth or their capital to be locked anywhere. For example, even my insane and annoying I remember like six months ago I just wanted to take out like $500 from the ATM at JPMORGAN Chase, and I could not, as the limit was around like 300 bucks? \ufffc And this is the thing which is really really weird to me \u2014 so I just want access to my money, why can\u2019t I have access to my own money? \ufffc Kind of a random aside; I like the idea of like being able to kind of clean up the world, either with whiteout tape, or blackout tape, we just met black bitcoin icons etc. So for example in Culver City and LA in general\u2026 My number one annoyance and greed is that there are so many annoying graffiti and ads all over the place. So first, I just wanna clean up the damn place. I want to get rid of annoying advertisements and stuff, because aesthetically I feel like I have a strong imperative to do so. Second, why is it so difficult or hard to promote some sort of well-being on the planet? So assuming that like 99% of our problems in life can be attributed to the fact of a poor money supply, then what that then means is that maybe like 99% of our world problems could actually be solved by bitcoin. For example, financial health. If money is toxic, capital is toxic, assuming that you\u2019re playing in the world of fiat currency, what that then means is that you don\u2019t actually want access to capital because it is like immediately causing you to bleed out economic energy and power. I actually had a super funny random thoughts; think about like the notion of semen retention and economic power retention. For example, every time you buy something expensive it is like blowing your load. For example, you lost for that matte black scissor door Lamborghini, and then you go out and buy it, for like $500,000 or something, like you just blown the biggest load of your life. But then the downside of that is after that, you\u2019re like kind of done, and as a consequence, what do you have left to live for? And actually the truth is, no man in his right mind would ever blow his load immediately before trying to lift 505 kg. Or also, assuming that you\u2019re about to have the big fight, nobody in their right mind would ever ever ever ever even consider for half a second, Rubbing one out real quick before the big fight. I actually have a thought thoughts on the first one is that you should not blow your load, anytime during the day because that is when your power is peak, that is when you have the most power. You should only ever blow your load in the evening right before you\u2019re about to sleep, like how the ancient Greeks did it. Example, can imagine Achilles blowing his load and inseminating one of his babes, immediately before the big battle? No! So I think this matter for a lot of reasons. First, it looks like everyone is sick unwell unhealthy. And not really out of their own fault, but rather, it seems like the bigger issue is that once again, we don\u2019t have healthy instruments to work with. For example, assume that you live in a society in which literally every single food item is laced and injected with high fructose corn syrup or sugar. Even if you want to lose fat and get a six pack and become strong healthy and happy, you cannot. Why? If everything has sugar added to it, even if you are the world\u2018s most diligent exerciser and individual, you can\u2019t do nothing! And as a consequence once again, you cannot blame an individual agent or individual for becoming fat or sick or unhealthy, if in fact the things that you are consuming and using or in fact, Giving you type two diabetes, maybe the current US dollar and monetary supply is like a metaphorical type two diabetes for Americans. Why do I care? So the trillion dollar question is like\u2026 Why do I care? First, once again, my moral and ethical imperative, growing up poor, having a dad who is addicted to gambling away the rent money, seeing my mom go through bankruptcy twice etc., almost homeless like four or five times, certainly gave me some sort of real life and real world education about economics. And I think this is where people fail\ufffc\u2014 they have never really really really really really seen people go through financial distress, financial duress, they\u2019ve never really witnessed it, nor did they really understand what it means? For example, a lot of these well to do Democrats liberals whatever, allow them actually come from quite affluent families. For example, a lot of people who lecture us about helping poor people blah blah blah, actually did not grow up poor. For example, unless you\u2019ve ever had the experience, being like an elementary school kid, in the fourth or fifth grade, maybe around 11 or 12 years old, having to pick up the phone, because your parents knew that it was probably creditors asking for money, and if you\u2019ve actually never had the experience of having to pretend online and say that your parents were not home, you don\u2019t know nothing. And maybe this is where I am the first self-made bitcoin millionaire; now that I\u2019m stacking 2.3 M\u2019s and beyond, things are starting to get really interesting to me, at almost a hilariously alarming pace. First, honestly it all seems like some sort of fake reality, it\u2019s still shocking to me whenever I see these numbers and balances. Still\u2026 The $90,000 mark for bitcoin hasn\u2019t really yet set in yet for me. And I\u2019m sure in certain when we hit the hundred thousand dollar mark for bitcoin, and we have $100,000 party, the best party of all time in cyberspace, and Michael saylors\u2018s house, we will all be laughing to the bank. Or better yet, the digital cyber base, a.k.a. our own home. Why is this such a big deal? I don\u2019t know any human being on the planet who does not desire some sort of financial freedom independence or liberty. I don\u2019t know anybody who wants to keep working there are boring 90 to 5 day job, doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re working at Amazon Apple Facebook Google; everyone I know, all my friends are working these big companies, Nobody wants to be there if they had the option\u2013 yet, they are tied to their mortgages, their other financial debts and obligations etc. And this is where I think to a large degree, debt is the devil. Why? That is slavery! And the funny thing is that a lot of people they like willingly put themselves into debt slavery. For the most part, because I\u2019ve grown up poor and whatever\u2026 I don\u2019t actually have that much compassion for people who do poor financial decisions with their life. When people go broke according to their own accord, zero compassion and empathy. For example, if people complain about finances, the first thing you gotta do is look at their iPhone or look at their Car. A lot of these people who complained that they\u2019re so broke all the time, they\u2019re the ones who are always buying the newest iPhone or iPhone Pro, buy new cars, paying a monthly payment on their car, sending their kids to daycare or private school or whatever, giving fellatio to Mark Zuckerberg, Essentially if you\u2019re on Instagram, you love the taste of Zuckerberg semen in your mouth. Also, the reason you should not trust Mark Zuckerberg, he pretends to be fake poor humble, \ufffc\ufffc\u2013 she himself still operates under this fa\u00e7ade of being a good guy, yet privately owns $10 million cars in his garage. And I\u2019m also pretty certain that Mark Zuckerberg has probably used the meta-quest at least once to check out virtual reality porn. Not that this is bad, but it is probably true. So what I really love about the financial freedom of bitcoin is that I think it sets people free. \ufffc For example, with bitcoin, you could go anywhere on the planet, and always have your wealth with you. You don\u2019t have to be tied down by nothing, not your loser Lamborghini your lose loser Porsche, and now, even your cyber truck. Ideally, all your wealth would always be portable, with you, in your front pocket in your iPhone, anywhere on the planet! A funny idea\u2026 Thank you you\u2019re making some matte black bitcoin patches, some matte black bitcoin stickers. If you\u2019re interested in copping some, just email me eric@erickim.com Once again, very very simple guys; senator Cynthia Lummis, she is introducing this really interesting bitcoin bill, in which America will like try to obtain 1 million bitcoins over four years. The legendary and mythical Nakamoto, which is 1 million bitcoins. \ufffc \ufffc America is money, America is manifest destiny. America is the best, the most powerful, the most dominant, and anyone who likes to think otherwise is either deluded, wrong, or somehow, anti-American? I don\u2019t really get it; technically, if you live in America, and you get paid in US dollars or whatever, it is actually like a super good deal. Why? First, essentially America could print money ad infinitum, for free, into infinity. So it seems actually super super obvious; to essentially, just print a bunch of money, buy the bitcoin, and take the upside, none of the downside. In fact, the really intelligent strategy \ufffc is the triple Trump Max strategy outlined by Michael Saylor in his presentation the red wave; to purchase 4 million bitcoins. If we own 6 million bitcoins, 2045,,, which is just 21 years from now, \u2026 $81T payoff! Also what is really fashion being is that bitcoins, is actually\u2026 Also built upon the bitcoin icon; everyone could easily notice the bitcoin icon from even 100 miles away. Yet, nobody has any clue or idea what Ethereum is. Or anything else. Another big idea in things to my colon doesn\u2019t everyone seek and desire some sort of financial prosperity? Like doesn\u2019t everyone want to be super super filthy dumb rich, whether they use that money for good like donations to charities or whatever, quitting your own nonprofit, helping poor kids, whatever? I think this is also another thing that people don\u2019t understand, capital control, \ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc financial control, financial power is real power. For example, I just went to Catholic mass the other day, and there was a second donation, for St. Vincent de Paul, helping poor families deal with paying the rent and utilities, not getting evicted etc. As long as the Catholic Church still asks for donations \u2014 money matters. In fact I really interesting thought is if the Catholic Church or the Vatican or whatever would build up their own strategic bitcoin reserve, then, the Catholic Church would last into perpetuity. And also never have to pay taxes. You\u2019re kind of matters because even if you\u2019re being taxed at a paltry rate of 1%, in like 30 or 40 years, assuming that you bought a $1 million home, you\u2019re going to send you be paying like half of that in just simple property taxes. \ufffc Or, if you purchase a one million $ home, and you have one percent tax, then over the course of 100 years, you\u2019re going to have already paid $1 million worth of property tax. Now why is this important? You cannot text bitcoin, if you just hold it. And don\u2019t sell it. Or transfer it. Also fortunately, there\u2019s no inheritance tax on bitcoin. Like if you die you could just give your private keys to your kids, and they will give it to their kids kids kids. No government meddling around with your family\u2019s wealth. \ufffc Even Sanator Lummis supports this idea, assuming that the bitcoin act passes, the bitcoin bill, I don\u2019t really see any reasons why it won\u2019t, essentially will give more clear property rights of private keys, to humans and American citizens? For example, nobody could stick a gun to your head, and force you to hand over your keys. \ufffc however, somebody could stick a gun to your head, and force you to give you your credit cards, your wallet, your credit card your stuff, or break into your home and steal the gold bars stuffed under your mattress. First, I think banks were generally a good thing the invention of it was beneficial in so far much as even me, I don\u2019t want to walk around with like $100,000 of US currency in my pocket. Why? The risk of me misplacing it, losing it, getting it stolen is quite high. For example like when I used to lift weights at the gym and I did not want to get distracted, Sometimes I would just like leave my backpack there, not really worrying whether people would steal my old iPhone SE, or steal the maybe $50 i had in my wallet. And this is the big idea, the idea that you could essentially store your own wealth, without a loser bank, a fucking asshole bank, I fucking hate the banks! Even these fucking assholes at JP Morgan Chase; literally taking me about three weeks before I could wire my own damn money to my Coinbase account, to just buy bitcoins for myself, even having to go to the branch like three or four times before doing it! \ufffc*** An interesting thing; if you have a certain upgraded bank status with JP Morgan Chase, they actually give you access to this free vault thing, where I guess you could hide your gold bars and antique Rolexes. You\u2019re not supposed to, but you can. I also would not be surprised that a lot of people probably hide US dollars or cash currency to avoid paying taxes, which I find to be a very very despicable act. I think with taxes, there is actually kind of like a moralistic obligation to pay taxes, certainly nobody wants to pay more than their fair share but still\u2026 I have a personal moral obligation to pay taxes. Why? Because once again, at least for myself, I was raised through the public school system, I went to UCLA, with federal government grants and scholarships, to become the person I am today. I am so insanely grateful to America American government, my mentors, my local Boy Scouts troop, \ufffc who knows maybe I\u2019ll start volunteering once Seneca is old enough. My sense of patriotism, is not this fake ass flag humping conservative Republican alt right, con toting fake ass libertarianism anti-government thing; even what a lot of these loser Republicans and conservatives don\u2019t understand is they are all apparently super anti-government, yet they want America to build a wall to keep out others? Or, they want the government to stay out of their gun business, but don\u2019t they understand that actually, the right to gun ownership is actually still predicated on the US government? Or, let us see that somebody breaks into your house, and either robs you or kills your family members, whatever\u2026 And even though you have a arsenal of guns, you were not able to stop all the perpetrators. If you want to enact justice, yet you are super anti-government, everyone is antigovernment until they need the government. \ufffc Then what I think people really want is like kind of maybe minimum government possible, MVP, MINIMUM VIABLE GOVERNMENT (MVG). I think the general idea is that certainly it is good to have the fire department if you don\u2019t want your house to burn down, ain\u2019t nobody gonna own their own fire hose to prevent their house from burning down. Also, it is certainly good to have a police department, a police force, once again, if somebody beat you up and rob you, and you catch them, you certainly want justice to be dealt to them. I think that it is like having just enough government, without the bloat? It\u2019s kind of like having a smart phone, certainly life is better with a smart phone rather than without. However the new ones is, ain\u2019t nobody want to own a loser android or Samsung phone, which has far too much bloatware. Even now Apple, there are too many damn apps. I don\u2019t really get it; Apple keeps turning out all these new apps, apps that nobody has any idea what it is, nor do people actually have any desire to use it, I said just let the third-party developers make those journaling apps and stuff. In fact, if Apple were really intelligent what Apple would do is actually with every subsequent version of iOS, they would actually get rid of superfluous apps! Like there\u2019s all these weird apps like the measuring tool and whatever. \ufffc Come on Apple just get rid of it. \ufffc\ufffc\ufffc When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING!

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. With JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning Washington that China and Russia are seeking to dismantle the Western world, and \u201cWorld War III has already begun\u201d, access to critical metals that serve as the fuel of America\u2019s military has become the most urgent issue of our time. Critical metals will determine superpower status and global domination. China is winning because it controls the bulk of the world\u2019s critical metals, from mining to refining. Washington has been slow to discover domestic or friendly resources, at a time when the U.S. Army desperately needs them. So, when a North American junior miner emerges as the owner of key critical metals properties in Europe and North America that could provide a new supply of one of these critical metals, the Western world sees hope. The critical metal that is now poised to make or break a global superpower is antimony, and the miner is Military Metals Corp. (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF) - a little-known company that just put itself on the critical metals map through some smart strategic acquisitions. Antimony (Sb), a critical metalloid, is a key element of the American war machine, essential for communication equipment, night vision goggles, explosives, ammunition, nuclear weapons, submarines, warships, optics, laser sighting and more, according to U.S. Army Major General (retired) James Marks. Not only does China control nearly half of the world\u2019s antimony production, but it also cut off antimony exports to the U.S. beginning in September this year. The U.S. Army is Now Desperate for Antimony China produces an astonishing ~70% of the world\u2019s rare earth minerals and controls nearly 50% of the global antimony supply. While China was pushing ahead at full speed, America was napping instead of discovering and developing new critical metals reserves. Then, at the height of the\u00a0trade war, China threatened to restrict the export of some rare earth minerals.\u00a0It made good on that threat this year, and last: First, with Germanium and Gallium in 2023, and then with antimony in September this year. Now, the U.S. Army has found itself short on an essential element of its military production line, just as war beckons from Europe to the Middle East. And it will need large amounts of antimony to succeed with a new push to ramp up production of artillery shells at newly launched manufacturing facilities after years of destocking. Meanwhile, American manufacturers use more than 50 million pounds of antimony each year for fireproofing compounds, batteries, ammunition, electronics, specialty glass, and other products, according to MetalTech. Now, it\u2019s past time for America to stake its claims on critical metals reserves, and Military Metals (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF) is helping to do just that. New Antimony Resources for the Coming Critical Demand Surge Military Metals Corp. is on an antimony acquisition binge that\u2019s taken it as far away as EU-member Slovakia, Nova Scotia in Canada and most recently in the US. It\u2019s planning to help retell the American antimony story by exploring new and re-developing historical venues that could chip away at China\u2019s control over what is essentially a \u201cmilitary metal\u201d. Military Metals Corp. recently announced that it has purchased one of Europe\u2019s largest antimony deposits in Slovakia with historical resources.\u00a0 In the heart of Central Europe, it\u2019s a promising Soviet-era resource with an initial discovery from the 1950s and prior development in the \u201880s and \u201890s. It\u2019s already seen two phases of exploration, including drilling and adit excavation.\u00a0 Source: Military Metals Corp.\u00a0 At the Trojarova Antimony Project, which could turn Slovakia into a European critical minerals hub, Military Metals Corp. says that underground development of this historical resource, funded by the Slovakian government, was shuttered in the 90s \u201cprior to reaching the richest part of the deposit\u201d. Back then, with the Cold War winding down, and antimony already having served its purpose as the hero of World War II, the motivation just wasn\u2019t there. Today, the situation is very different, and EU\u2019S Trojarova project--with a historical resource of over 61,998 tons of antimony worth around $ 2 billion in situ value at today\u2019s spot prices\u2014could now become a military kingmaker. Figure 1 Military Metals Corp. (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF): But Military Metals Corp. isn\u2019t concentrating all of its effects on a single continent: it\u2019s also making huge moves back in North America, in Canada\u2019s famous WWI antimony mine in Nova Scotia. Military Metals Corp. is sitting on a recently acquired historical antimony\/gold play, the West Gore Antimony Project\u2014one of Canada\u2019s biggest past producing antimony mine and a key supplier to the Allied Forces in WWI. It's an impressive historical resource, with historical drilling results demonstrating over 7 meters of 10.6 gpt gold and 3.4% antimony. It\u2019s not stopping there, however. On October 24th, 2024, the company pounced on another opportunity to further consolidate this territory by signing an LOI to acquire more claims flanking West Gore. The move to consolidate territory surrounding West Gore\u2014one of the biggest heroes of WWI\u2014is a strategic move that could tie the junior miner directly to North American defense at a time when prices are skyrocketing. The Antimony Land Rush is a Junior Game This smart, fast-moving investment strategy could, according to Forbes, be the \u201clatest to generate short-term profits of more than 100% on money invested\u201d. Forbes was right, even if it underestimated the returns. Shares in junior mining stocks focused on antimony have surged recently, netting investors up to 800% returns in a very short time. Australian ASX-listed companies were the first to light up the exchange, with shares in domestic Larvotto Resources Ltd. (ASX:LRV) surging over 800% in the past six months. The Australian government has placed antimony on its critical metals list, and Australian traders are calling it an \u201cantimony party\u201d. But compared to its closet peer, Perpetua Resources, Military Metals Corp. appears to have quite a lot of room to run, based on resource estimates and current valuation. Perpetua is currently valued at around $700 million, with ~90,000 tons of antimony. The U.S. government is in the process of providing a $1.86 billion loan to Perpetua to have their Antimony mine in production by 2029. Military Metals Corp. is valued at only $23 million right now; but its new play in Slovakia is valued at $2 billion in situ of ore at today\u2019s Antimony spot prices that keeps climbing every week. And that\u2019s only one of its new antimony acquisitions. When you add the potential of West Gore in Nova Scotia, valuations could get even more attractive. Pricing Power on the Brink of War Military Metals Corp. CEO Scott Eldridge sees a major antimony supply crunch coming. He\u2019s certainly not alone. \u201cAn extreme supply shortage since April has led to the sharpest price rally ever recorded in the antimony market since Fastmarkets started pricing the metal back in the early 1980s,\u201d according to the UK\u2019s Minor Metals Trade Association (MMTA). \u201cThe military uses of Sb [antimony] are now the tail that wags the dog. Everyone needs it for armaments so it is better to hang onto it than sell it,\u201d Christopher Ecclestone of London-based Hallgarten & Company recently told the Financial Review, calling it a \u201csign of the times\u201d. \u201cThis will put a real squeeze on the US and European militaries,\u201d Ecclestone added. Germany has essentially been demilitarized, with its own defense ministry estimating it has about 2 days of ammunition if there is a war with Russia, which it expects to happen within the next few years at most. Germany and the EU have mandated 2 million artillery shells to be manufactured by the end of 2025 with a investment of 500,000,000 euros. Indeed, antimony prices have more than tripled since earlier this year from $12,000 per ton to over $38,000. Two major wars are already involving enemies and allies on four continents, and World War III is already underway for all intents and purposes, making Military Metals Corp.\u2019s (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF) strategic acquisition binge a fast-moving opportunity that continues to expand with every day that China squeezes supply and America is stuck playing catch-up. Everyone from the U.S. Department of Defense to their Western counterparts around the world is now scrambling to secure new supply, and China is determined to keep the critical mineral taps turned off as it hoards the metal necessary to shore up U.S. defenses.

As the global financial landscape gravitates toward more efficient and inclusive solutions, stablecoins are emerging as a powerful alternative to traditional banking by delivering seamless cross-border transactions, low-cost remittances, and instant settlements. Top banks, including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Signature, and others, use blockchain solutions for multiple purposes, from cross-border payments to foreign currency trades. But what does this shift mean for businesses, consumers, and the financial ecosystem, especially in Africa?\nStablecoins and Traditional Banking: An Ideal Marriage? \nIn the last decade, banking has been on a revolutionary high in terms of technological adoption and this has changed how companies approach finance, allowing traditional banks to collaborate with fintechs and offer financial products directly to customers. However, with stablecoins like USDC, USDT and more recently Africa-focused stablecoins like and AFRO, the accessibility, speed, and affordability of transactions are now challenging banking solutions. Stablecoins provide a borderless, low-cost digital currency that enables instant transactions without the need for intermediaries, saving time and making financial services more accessible.\nHow Stablecoins Are Enhancing Inclusive and Accessible Financial Services in Africa. \nStablecoins, often pegged to major fiat currencies like the US dollar, offer the best of both worlds: the stability of traditional currency and the innovation of digital assets. The impact is felt globally, but it\u2019s particularly powerful in emerging economies like Nigeria and Kenya, where remittances and cross-border payments play a crucial economic role. With 63% of Africa\u2019s population unbanked, there is enormous untapped potential for the further adoption of blockchain-based solutions as an alternative to traditional payment options.\nIn 2024 alone, the IMF and World Bank reported a 15% reduction in cross-border remittance costs for stablecoin-supported transactions across African markets. This decrease in \n\n\n\n\n\n\ncosts not only saves money but also makes financial inclusion more achievable for underserved populations.\nFor Africa, stablecoins hold particular promise by reducing dependence on volatile local currencies and enabling faster, less expensive transactions across borders. Today, roughly 33% of Nigerians own or use cryptocurrency and over 70% of these crypto users leverage stablecoins for cross-border payments, saving time and money compared to traditional banking channels. As stablecoins provide a decentralized alternative, they also allow users to avoid high remittance fees and fluctuating exchange rates\u2014challenges that have long hindered financial growth in many African nations.\nIn developed countries, stablecoins are also revolutionizing the financial landscape by simplifying B2B transactions, enabling faster supply chain settlements, and allowing for real-time payroll distribution, even across borders. This ripple effect is setting the stage for a future where crypto and stablecoins coalesce with mainstream finance for improved efficiency and inclusivity worldwide.        \nThe Power of Stablecoin Integration \n\nPayPal\u2019s USD Stablecoin: Earlier this year, Paypal launched its USD-backed stablecoin PYUSD, which is backed by the US Dollars and which has already been integrated into its platform, allowing users worldwide to make seamless, instant transactions. By incorporating stablecoin transactions, PayPal has expanded its offering to meet the needs of a new generation of crypto users and demonstrated a clear path for Web2 companies to adapt to blockchain innovations.\nVisa\u2019s Stablecoin Experimentation: Visa made headlines in 2024 with its pilot program to use USDC on the Ethereum blockchain for settling transactions with global partners. Through this integration, Visa significantly reduced the complexities and costs associated with cross-border payments, creating a framework that other companies can emulate. They went on to create the Visa Onchain Analytics Dashboard which according to the company \u2018is designed to be an easily-digestible, freely-available window into publicly-available aggregated blockchain data, beginning with stablecoins\u2019.\nAfrican Fintech Adopters: In Africa, companies like Flutterwave and Chippercash are exploring stablecoin integrations to overcome currency volatility and facilitate affordable cross-border transactions. This step not only supports Africans in sending and receiving money but also provides a safe hedge against inflation in countries like Nigeria and Zimbabwe, where currency value can be unpredictable.\n\nWhat Does the Future Hold? \nWhile blockchain solutions have enabled financial inclusion and opened doors for non-financial institutions to deliver banking services, stablecoins are taking it a step further, enabling people globally to transact freely, affordably, and securely. As regulatory frameworks around stablecoins evolve, the potential for mainstream adoption grows. In Africa stablecoins present a unique opportunity to leapfrog traditional financial infrastructure and establish a more\naccessible and resilient system. This innovative technology can foster intra-continental trade and facilitate integration with global markets.\nStablecoins are gradually becoming the backbone of digital payments, offering stability, transparency, and accessibility, which are foundational to the next phase of financial innovation. As more organizations integrate these solutions, the lines between traditional and decentralized finance will continue to blur, offering a glimpse into a more inclusive financial future for us all.\nCurrently, just a handful of cryptocurrency companies in Africa are licensed to offer solutions that enable businesses to integrate blockchain and stablecoin solutions. Amongst these businesses is Quidax , an African-founded cryptocurrency exchange that makes it easy for anyone to buy, sell, store and transfer cryptocurrencies using their Crypto API.\nIf you\u2019re interested in exploring how stablecoins and other blockchain innovations can transform your bank, fintech or business, you can check out the Quidax Crypto API to learn how you can integrate these solutions and prepare for the future of finance.\nSocial Links \nTwitter: https:\/\/twitter.com\/QuidaxGlobal\nFacebook: https:\/\/facebook.com\/QuidaxGlobal     \nInstagram: https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/quidaxglobal\nLinkedIn: https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/quidax\/\nQuidax Global Community (Telegram): https:\/\/t.me\/OfficialQuidaxCommunity Quidax Academy: https:\/\/blog.quidax.ng\/quidax-academy-beginner-crypto-course\/\nCreative for blogpost\n                                             In the last decade, banking has been on a revolutionary high in terms of technological adoption and this has changed how companies approach finance, allowing traditional banks to collaborate with fintechs and offer financial products directly to customers.

The SEC has met our mission and enforced the law without fear or favor,\" Gensler, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden in 2021, said in a statement.\u00a0 Known for his hard-charging style, Gensler led an ambitious agenda to boost transparency, reduce systemic risks, and stamp out conflicts of interest on Wall Street, completing dozens of new rules, some of which have been challenged in court.\u00a0 Among his major accomplishments were changes to increase the resilience and efficiency of U.S. markets, including speeding up trade settlements and overhauling the $28 trillion Treasuries market, as well as a number of rules boosting investor disclosures and corporate governance.\u00a0 The Baltimore native also successfully implemented rules mandated by Congress imposing SEC oversight on auditors of U.S.-listed Chinese companies, ending a decade-long tussle with Beijing that lawmakers said had put U.S. investors at risk.\u00a0 On the enforcement front, Gensler's SEC broke new ground with a multi-year effort focused on Wall Street's use of text, WhatsApp and other unauthorized channels to discuss business, levying more than $2 billion in fines against dozens of firms, including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. He also took on the crypto industry, suing Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN), Kraken, Binance and others, alleging that their failure to register with the agency violated SEC rules, accusations the companies deny and are fighting in court. When it comes to crypto, the courts have mostly backed Gensler's positions. But his sweeping agenda and uncompromising posture sparked intense pushback from Wall Street, as well as congressional Republicans, and even some Democrats.\u00a0 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Managed Funds Association and other groups sued in the conservative-leaning Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and elsewhere to overturn at least eight rules, arguing they were unjustified, harmful or beyond the SEC's authority. Jill Fisch, a University of Pennsylvania law professor specializing in securities regulation, said Gensler would depart with a mixed legacy. \"I think there are clearly some victories, but I would say he came in with a fairly aggressive rule-making agenda and most of that either hasn't or isn't likely to endure.\" TRUMP TRANSITION In a major blow to the agency, the Fifth Circuit ruled in June that the SEC did not have the authority to oversee the $27 trillion private funds industry. That loss, and other legal challenges, have slowed the agency's rule-making this year, and could impede the agency in the long run, Reuters reported.  Just before Gensler's announcement on Thursday, a federal judge in Texas struck down the SEC's overhaul of Treasury dealer rules adopted earlier this year. Some critics also say Gensler's crypto crusade was ill-conceived and damaged the U.S. economy by stifling innovation and pushing crypto companies offshore, criticism he has rejected. In a speech this month, he argued history has shown that \"robust securities regulation both creates trust in markets and fosters innovation.\" Trump has not said who would replace Gensler, although he is widely expected to appoint one of the current Republican SEC commissioners, Hester Peirce or Mark Uyeda, as acting head of the agency.   Reuters previously reported that Trump's transition team is considering former SEC officials for the job permanently.

Washington has been slow to discover domestic or friendly resources, at a time when the U.S. Army desperately needs them.So, when a North American junior miner emerges as the owner of key critical metals properties in Europe and North America that could provide a new supply of one of these critical metals, the Western world sees hope.The critical metal that is now poised to make or break a global superpower is antimony, and the miner is Military Metals (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF) - a little-known company that just put itself on the critical metals map through some smart strategic acquisitions.Antimony (Sb), a critical metalloid, is a key element of the American war machine, essential for communication equipment, night vision goggles, explosives, ammunition, nuclear weapons, submarines, warships, optics, laser sighting and more, according to U.S. Army Major General (retired) James Marks.Not only does China control nearly half of the world\u2019s antimony production, but it also cut off antimony exports to the U.S. beginning in September this year.The U.S. Army is Now Desperate for AntimonyChina produces an astonishing ~70% of the world\u2019s rare earth minerals and controls nearly 50% of the global antimony supply.\u00a0\n\n\n  While China was pushing ahead at full speed, America was napping instead of discovering and developing new critical metals reserves.Then, at the height of the\u00a0trade war, China threatened to restrict the export of some rare earth minerals.\u00a0It made good on that threat this year, and last: First, with Germanium and Gallium in 2023, and then with antimony in September this year.Now, the U.S. Army has found itself short on an essential element of its military production line, just as war beckons from Europe to the Middle East. And it will need large amounts of antimony to succeed with a new push to ramp up production of artillery shells at newly launched manufacturing facilities after years of destocking.Meanwhile, American manufacturers use more than 50 million pounds of antimony each year for fireproofing compounds, batteries, ammunition, electronics, specialty glass, and other products, according to MetalTech.Now, it\u2019s past time for America to stake its claims on critical metals reserves, and Military Metals (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF) is helping to do just that.New Antimony Resources for the Coming Critical Demand SurgeMilitary Metals is on an antimony acquisition binge that\u2019s taken it as far away as EU-member Slovakia, Nova Scotia in Canada and most recently in the US.It\u2019s planning to help retell the American antimony story by exploring new and re-developing historical venues that could chip away at China\u2019s control over what is essentially a \u201cmilitary metal\u201d.Military Metals recently announced that it has purchased one of Europe\u2019s largest antimony deposits in Slovakia with historical resources.\u00a0 In the heart of Central Europe, it\u2019s a promising Soviet-era resource with an initial discovery from the 1950s and prior development in the \u201880s and \u201890s. It\u2019s already seen two phases of exploration, including drilling and adit excavation.\u00a0  Source: Military Metals.\u00a0At the Trojarova Antimony Project, which could turn Slovakia into a European critical minerals hub, Military Metals says that underground development of this historical resource, funded by the Slovakian government, was shuttered in the 90s \u201cprior to reaching the richest part of the deposit\u201d.Back then, with the Cold War winding down, and antimony already having served its purpose as the hero of World War II, the motivation just wasn\u2019t there.Today, the situation is very different, and EU\u2019S Trojarova project--with a historical resource of over 61,998 tons of antimony worth around $ 2 billion in situ value at today\u2019s spot prices\u2014could now become a military kingmaker.\u00a0\u00a0  Figure 1 Military Metals (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF):But Military Metals isn\u2019t concentrating all of its effects on a single continent: it\u2019s also making huge moves back in North America, in Canada\u2019s famous WWI antimony mine in Nova Scotia.Military Metals is sitting on a recently acquired historical antimony\/gold play, the West Gore Antimony Project\u2014one of Canada\u2019s biggest past producing antimony mine and a key supplier to the Allied Forces in WWI.It's an impressive historical resource, with historical drilling results demonstrating over 7 meters of 10.6 gpt gold and 3.4% antimony.  It\u2019s not stopping there, however.On October 24th, 2024, the company pounced on another opportunity to further consolidate this territory by signing an LOI to acquire more claims flanking West Gore.The move to consolidate territory surrounding West Gore\u2014one of the biggest heroes of WWI\u2014is a strategic move that could tie the junior miner directly to North American defense at a time when prices are skyrocketing.The Antimony Land Rush is a Junior GameThis smart, fast-moving investment strategy could, according to Forbes, be the \u201clatest to generate short-term profits of more than 100% on money invested\u201d.\u00a0Forbes was right, even if it underestimated the returns.Shares in junior mining stocks focused on antimony have surged recently, netting investors up to 800% returns in a very short time.Australian ASX-listed companies were the first to light up the exchange, with shares in domestic Larvotto Resources Ltd. (ASX:LRV) surging over 800% in the past six months.The Australian government has placed antimony on its critical metals list, and Australian traders are calling it an \u201cantimony party\u201d.But compared to its closet peer, Perpetua Resources, Military Metals\u00a0appears to have quite a lot of room to run, based on resource estimates and current valuation.Perpetua is currently valued at around $700 million, with ~90,000 tons of antimony. The U.S. government is in the process of providing a $1.86 billion loan to Perpetua to have their Antimony mine in production by 2029.Military Metals is valued at only $23 million right now; but its new play in Slovakia is valued at $2 billion in situ of ore at today\u2019s Antimony spot prices that keeps climbing every week. And that\u2019s only one of its new antimony acquisitions. When you add the potential of West Gore in Nova Scotia, valuations could get even more attractive.Pricing Power on the Brink of WarMilitary Metals CEO Scott Eldridge sees a major antimony supply crunch coming.He\u2019s certainly not alone.\u201cAn extreme supply shortage since April has led to the sharpest price rally ever recorded in the antimony market since Fastmarkets started pricing the metal back in the early 1980s,\u201d according to the UK\u2019s Minor Metals Trade Association (MMTA).\u201cThe military uses of Sb [antimony] are now the tail that wags the dog. Everyone needs it for armaments so it is better to hang onto it than sell it,\u201d Christopher Ecclestone of London-based Hallgarten & Company recently told the Financial Review, calling it a \u201csign of the times\u201d.\u201cThis will put a real squeeze on the US and European militaries,\u201d Ecclestone added. Germany has essentially been demilitarized, with its own defense ministry estimating it has about 2 days of ammunition if there is a war with Russia, which it expects to happen within the next few years at most. Germany and the EU have mandated 2 million artillery shells to be manufactured by the end of 2025 with a investment of 500,000,000 euros.Indeed, antimony prices have more than tripled since earlier this year from $12,000 per ton to over $38,000.Two major wars are already involving enemies and allies on four continents, and World War III is already underway for all intents and purposes, making Military Metals' (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF) strategic acquisition binge a fast-moving opportunity that continues to expand with every day that China squeezes supply and America is stuck playing catch-up.Everyone from the U.S. Department of Defense to their Western counterparts around the world is now scrambling to secure new supply, and China is determined to keep the critical mineral taps turned off as it hoards the metal necessary to shore up U.S. defenses.Other companies that are worth keeping a close eye on: Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) Northrop Grumman is a leading global security company providing innovative systems, products, and solutions in autonomous systems, cyber, C4ISR, space, strike, and logistics and modernization to customers worldwide.

What is the difference? Well the general difference is that an engineer, do you think about things first principles, use stare deeply and analyze deeply into the true nature of things, and what that then means is you understand the true nature of things. Then I guess, I kinda do think like an engineer, carte blanche principles. For example, so much of this modern day BS about almost everything, seems to be mostly a social problem. Sociology, maybe could also be understand as the sociology of engineering, also social engineering? So once again, if you understand Leonardo da Vinci like the Golden standard of an engineer, somebody who is part curious, partially playful, kind of like imagine a big kid on steroids; infinite curiosity about everything. Maybe also\u2026 I\u2019m like the next Leonardo da Vinci, but a lot richer And far more jacked? Even the problem of a Leonard da Vinci, I still think he got his patronage from the Medici\u2019s? Which means that he was not financially independent; and the truth is ultimately, without personal financial independence, you cannot really really have 100% true freedom and power. \ufffc I might be the first to thought this; what is bitcoin? To me it is like solidified happiness. If you took all this economic power energy joy and happiness, and you could solidify it into a thing, to me that would be a bitcoin. For example, every time I see my bitcoin balance swell, and become greater, it brings a huge smile to my face, a huge voyage grin to my face, whatever scenario. And then also then the thing is\u2026 The bitcoin is like almost kind of imaginary. Like doesn\u2019t really exist anywhere in the physical realm, it only exists in cyberspace, your mind. So for example, if I want to prove to you my bitcoin balance I can just take out my phone or iPad and prove it to you immediately\u2026 So I guess this is the cool thoughts; now that I\u2019m super fucking rich and powerful and godlike glorious, I could just walk into any sort of Lamborghini or Ferrari or Porsche dealership, and just automatically assume and demand a test drive! And also the extreme joy, I could just handle and touch everything, and fuck with stuff, like I own it. Because I do. So once again, I think the hardest thing to think like an engineer is that at least for myself, I majored in sociology, always thought the engineering was like two math heavy, and was about following the rules. However, if you really think about real engineering, like building a bridge or making planes fly etc.\u2026 It is 100% rooted in physics and reality. The hard thing with ethics philosophy, as well as opinions, politics, sociology ethics etc. is that they are not focused on reality. Or nature. So for example, the fucking insanity of somehow allowing 12-year-old kids, have access to puberty blockers, hormone inhibitors, hormone amplifiers, etc.\u2026 At such a young age? Mother nature does not produce steroids or estrogen in pill or injection format naturally. The tricky thing is when people talk about nature\u2026 Like what is it that people really are talking about? Are they talking about like human nature, our DNA, our primordial being and nature? Or are we talking about like trees and stuff? Not really sure. Anyways, first principles first principles thinking. So the first line of things is kind of do like a hard reformat of the past and prior knowledge, and think things totally carte blanche, blank slate, white slate, black canvas, right now. Like if you just wiped the tablet clean, tabula rasa \u2014 how would you do things, right now, in the year 2024? For example\u2026 I\u2019m a huge fan of stick shift, the upsides of gasoline etc., and hybrid cars and Priuses, but the real truth is, if you somehow erased all the cars on the planet, today, and you somehow had to create automobiles and vehicles for all 8 billion of us right now\u2026 How would it and how should it look like? It would probably be like all self driving Teslas, obviously electric cars. I think the biggest problem about petroleum cars are tailpipe admissions. If you have ever been in local LA traffic or the 405 or the 10 during peak rush-hour when you see a car with that converter on, and you have your windows down and that insanely fucking toxic tailpipe chemicals are going straight into your lungs, You will actually know first hand, that the truth is this is obviously bad for your health. And the health of your kid and family and society. For example, imagine like you have a 1960s Camaro, without a catalytic converter. Would you allow it to run idle, in your garage with all the windows closed, with the tailpipe directly in the throat of your four-year-old child? Obviously not! So I think there are some simple practical things; First, tailpipe emissions are obviously 1 trillion times bad. Second, assuming that we all have nuclear vision or whatever, then electricity should practically be free. Then, Teslas and electric cars makes sense. Third also assuming that the Tesla super charging network is growing like a virus, the obvious thing thing is that it will continue to grow at an exponential rate. For example, it is very difficult to structurally build a gasoline station somewhere, but the only reason we keep using it is that it is already there, fast and convenient and cheap. But once again, if you started a totally brand new society in the middle of the desert, obviously it would probably be centered around electric cars and electric vehicles, as the upside of building a Tesla supercharger is very easy, Far easier than building anything else. Are you a demigod or a weakling? Simple bifurcation. So my personal understanding is that the reason why people seek refuge in the past is that it is an act of cowardice, only pussies are romantics. \ufffcI thought about this for a long time but what is it in fact, the history of the word \u201cromance, and why do they call it \u201cromantic\u201d? \ufffc\ufffc\ufffc Thank God for ChatGPT. They said you talked about how the notion was \u201cromanz\u201d\u2013 essentially it were works that are created in the romance language languages, like Italian Spanish French etc. Anything that was not Latin. But the problem about this movement is that it emphasized concepts and ideas that were quite degenerate in nature. For example, over excessive feelings, I think the medieval literature of knightly chivalry etc. to be \u201cgallant\u201d\u2013 even the Vietnamese have a term \u201cgallant\u201d\u2013 like when you\u2019re opening a door for a woman to get out of a taxi, just like a knight who takes off his robe to cover a puddle to let a woman walk across it? People don\u2019t really give it a second thought\u2026 \ufffc everyone assumes that to be romantic is a good thing? Like somehow this fucking insane idea I spent six months of your salary to buy your fianc\u00e9 a diamond wedding ring, which is just a fake commodity. My greatest pride is that for my engagement ring to Cindy only spent like 300 bucks on a really beautiful purple tinted cubic zirconia diamond, super smart. And also wore the wise; if you\u2019re planning on getting married or engaged or whatever\u2026 Never spend more than $300 on a wedding ring. Bitcoin is like your new cyber estate. The other day I saw a new funny Zen Wabisabi minimalist hipster house, one of those really cool new three-story teepees they build on a small plot of land listed for $4.4 million. And this is for like a super tiny plot of land, even on a square block, you can feel like 30 of these houses on it. So assuming that bitcoin is like digital real estate, or digital property, and there are only like 21 million of them on the planet forever, and also whenever you\u2019re on the 405 driving during peak rush-hour, you might see like 21 million cars on the road. And how many humans live in Los Angeles? Like 100 million? anyways, like imagine that I was a genie and I waved a magic wand and I told you that there would only be our 21 million single family homes, on the whole planet, forever. And there would never ever ever be more single-family homes ever produced. Wouldn\u2019t you want to nab one, for a super steal of a price, only $100,000? My thought is obviously you need the utility of somewhere to live, and this is where paying rent is like a quadrillion times smarter than buying real estate a single-family home, property, a condo etc. A lot of people have this foolish idea; I\u2019m gonna buy like a condo or a single-family home or whatever for two reasons: first, utility value like a place to live. Second, as an \u201cinvestment\u201d. However the reason why this is not good is that if you really want to maximize your investment, it is super simple you just buy bitcoin! It\u2019s going to go up forever until it hits $55 million a bitcoin, and then probably $105 million a bitcoin etc. \ufffc\ufffc I was watching CNBC a video retweet by Michael Saylor, showing that now as of today bitcoins options trading is live! And literally everyone has their jaws dropped, everyone is like confused and befuddled, shock and all, everyone has no idea what to think. Even I\u2019m shocked? Even I\u2019m confused! A very good sign. So if you watch traditional news, the Telly etc, what do you see? Apple Apple Apple, Nvidia Nvidia Nvidia, Tesla Tesla Tesla, etc. Why don\u2019t you see microstrategy? \ufffcMSTR, which is pretty much nuclear at this point. It is literally like the hottest stock on the planet, maybe the whole human universe? \ufffc Like it is kind of insane\u2026 I just converted all of our Roth IRA and our traditional retirement accounts, IRA, etc., and some random spare cash we had lying around all into MicroStrategy, just like three months ago, in September, when the stock was like only $140 or 130 a share. Now, it is going ballistic; $499 @ share, and I\u2019m not gonna be shocked when you see MicroStrategy at $10,000 or even $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 or even $50,000 a share! Why? \ufffc It is simple, it is a brand new carte blanche, a totally brand new, perfectly engineered company. If you created a totally brand new company in the year 2024, assuming that next year January 2025 is going to be year one of institutional acceptance of bitcoin, And assuming that we have this phenomenally glorious red wave, which means we have a full pro bitcoin Senate house president etc., and everyone is going all in on bitcoin! My personal thought is the next four years, assuming that you put all your wealth into bitcoin and or MSTR microstrategy stock, I will not be surprised to see your wealth 50X from here. \ufffc Why? Once again, bitcoin is the first perfectly engineered money and capital digital capital. Up until now, the US dollar, field currency was kind of like the least bad thing that we could make of, if you read The Fist Standard by Saifedean, you actually see that was really good for the period of time in which we needed it. Because for ordinary transactions, walking around with gold bars and or gold coins was not really practical. And especially for international trade, fiat currency the banking Swift system was mostly useful. But now that we have tether, circle and the like; you actually see a lot of Chinese corporations, I saw a lot last summer in Cambodia, even mainland Chinese companies are using tether for payments instead of the Chinese yuan, etc. Michael Saylor has an idea that we should have tether relocate her headquarters to America, and if this is the case, \u2026 this would be very good for America and everybody. \ufffc\ufffc\ufffcSo to anybody new to the space, we often think and hear of bitcoin and the like being called crypto, cryptocurrency etc. But it is not. \ufffc Bitcoin is digital capital, everything else is like a speculation and or like cotton candy or like a fake cubic zirconia diamond. Come on just look at the prices of bitcoin versus Ethereum. This is like literally the best day of all time, November 20, 2024 \u2014 bitcoin breaking around $95,000 of bitcoin, and everyone is rooting and waiting for the $100K party. \ufffc I feel bad for all of these Ethereum losers, even people with chainlink, they are all wrong. \ufffc Everyone is a winner on the bitcoin standard. The nuance is that there are just varying degrees of success. My simple workflow is that you just buy micro strategy, write it up, and shave some off of the top in order to buy more bitcoin. \ufffc\ufffc MSTR \u2013> BTC For example, if you purchase like $150,000 worth of microstrategy stock, and then it goes up to $200,000 worth, it is very simple, you just sell $50,000 worth the stock, transfer that to your checking account, and then buy $50,000 of bitcoin, \ufffcjust using Coinbase or whatever app or platform or thing you have access to. \ufffc Bitcoin, is the true digital capital, like owning the square of blocks of cyber Manhattan. Ultimately, if you\u2019re a really really really rich wealthy family, the best is to brag about how many square blocks of Manhattan your own. For example if you own like 21 square blocks of Manhattan, right next to fifth Avenue, and Central Park, This is worth like billions of dollars. You never sell like a square block of fifth Avenue, in order to buy a Lamborghini or Starbucks Frappuccino\u2019s. Even more so, you don\u2019t sell like a 10th of your apartment building for a couple coffee or a sandwich. Once again, just imagine like a single bitcoin being like a square block in Manhattan, but the reason why owning bitcoin is even superior to own a square block in Manhattan is that in technicality, you could actually produce more land even on the main island; just look at That one dude who built up the docks, you could just pour concrete sand and land to extend the island, to build more artificial land. Or you could just tear down old buildings and build more skyscraper that flow ever more upwards. My personal thought is that there are people who just want fixed regular income. For example if you just want to FIRE, financial independence retire early, and you just want a magical $10,000 USD to be deposited to your checking account, forever, then the best strategy is to just buy microstrategy stock, write it up, and at the end of every month when rent and stuff is due just sell some micro garage stock, for your living expenses, paying for your rent your beef ribs at Costco etc. \ufffc I have the keys to all success, we the best! (BITCOIN, DJ KHALED) \ufffc conspiracy theories aside, structurally, the truth is the system is rigged against you. Why? It was engineered that way. For example, even in America today, we are currently operating on 20th century rails, yet it is the 21st-century. I\u2019m very interesting thing I learned from Michael Saylor about the history of science is that the reason why most cars and vehicles are the width it is today is that it is simply based off of the size of the rails that the ancient Romans did for her roads; All roads lead to Rome. I think people are starting to wake up\u2026 They\u2019re starting to realize that their Dogecoin, Shiba Inu coin, memecoins, altcoins, ethereum, chainlink etc aren\u2019t actually worth anything. Naturally, Wu-Wei \u2014 all of the weaker currencies and assets shall flow into the stronger ones. What that means is your already seeing it, I\u2019m Exodus in a flight from Ethereum into bitcoin, which is like 1 trillion times better sexier cooler more desirable stronger and superior in every sort of way. For example, would you rather be driving the old Volkswagen Passat, or the cybertruck on steroids? \ufffc Or, would you rather have the horse and buggy, or would you rather have the Rolls-Royce the Bentley or the Lexus LS? Fully loaded LS\u2019s,,, ah yes! \u2013 JAY Z \ufffc one of my great happinesses is that I did not formally study economics. Why is it such a good thing? I also never studied business, another good thing. The reason is all the old models are wrong, and whenever we simply try to copy the past models, we will not succeed in massively because true successes are carte Blanche, insanely awesome. For example, it seems now that Tesla in Nvidia was such obvious investing decisions, or like buying Apple in the 1980s. Or buying Google or Amazon or even Microsoft in the early days. Now, if I could tell you that there is this thing or company or concept \ufffc Fan is actually in fact like 1 million times more valuable than Apple Amazon Facebook google etc.\u2026 And that is gonna take over the whole planet, wouldn\u2019t you want to buy a piece of the pie? The big idea, if you were like in mainland China, even if you wanted to buy Apple Amazon Facebook etc., you couldn\u2019t because these are US American securities. With bitcoin, you can! It does not matter what your jurisdiction your country your thing is etc. If you are in Nairobi, Afghanistan, Shanghai, Beirut, the Netherlands whatever, anyone and everyone could purchase bitcoin. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s even clever ways you could do it in Cuba. Another interesting thought from Michael Saylor, considering that he studied history of science at MIT, which sounds like a very very good major, a good idea, maybe if Seneca gets into MIT and wants to study history of science, I\u2019ll send him. Anyways, Michael Saylor studied aeronautical engineering, and although he is a huge fan of Elon Musk he also is a bit critical; before we go to outer space, why not go into cyberspace instead? The notion cyber is actually super funny because it is kind of like an antiquated term; but as of late has become cool again. Like cyberpunk, cyber truck etc. Actually the funny thing was in the early 90s, when I was a kid, on AOL instant messenger, when you said \u201cWanna cyber?\u201d What is essentially sexual innuendo like do you wanna have sexy online erotic talk? Anyways, the reason why cyberspace seems to be a good field is that this is where all the economic energy power and warfare is heading. For example out of all the traditional job pats, cyber security seems to be the most important one, also \u201cpenetration testing\u201c. This is where the big money is. But beyond that, it is obviously bitcoin. Bitcoin is and will become the global monetary network, I\u2019m also certain we could even use bitcoin when we go to Mars. If you want to bring your wealth with you on a spaceship to the moon or Mars or whatever, it seems pretty obvious that you would probably Bring bitcoin. You\u2019re not going to take your square block in Manhattan or Culver City with you; you cannot take gold bars with you on a spaceship, nor can you bring Fiat currency, your JP Morgan Chase, your Lamborghini etc. The reason is because, once you have produced and created the bitcoin, it will last forever. There is nothing in the whole human universe that will last forever, as a result of physics and decay etc. But a bitcoin does. \ufffc\ufffc Buy happiness, buy Bitcoin!

Creative engineering: So one of the really fast things I learned from Michael Saylor in his last interview with Natalie Brunell at the end what is what was misconception about him; and he said, the greatest misconception was that Michael Saylor was a traitor, but the reality is\u2026 He\u2019s an engineer. What is the difference? Well the general difference is that an engineer, do you think about things first principles, use stare deeply and analyze deeply into the true nature of things, and what that then means is you understand the true nature of things. Then I guess, I kinda do think like an engineer, carte blanche principles. For example, so much of this modern day BS about almost everything, seems to be mostly a social problem. Sociology, maybe could also be understand as the sociology of engineering, also social engineering? So once again, if you understand Leonardo da Vinci like the Golden standard of an engineer, somebody who is part curious, partially playful, kind of like imagine a big kid on steroids; infinite curiosity about everything. Maybe also\u2026 I\u2019m like the next Leonardo da Vinci, but a lot richer And far more jacked? Even the problem of a Leonard da Vinci, I still think he got his patronage from the Medici\u2019s? Which means that he was not financially independent; and the truth is ultimately, without personal financial independence, you cannot really really have 100% true freedom and power. \ufffc I might be the first to thought this; what is bitcoin? To me it is like solidified happiness. If you took all this economic power energy joy and happiness, and you could solidify it into a thing, to me that would be a bitcoin. For example, every time I see my bitcoin balance swell, and become greater, it brings a huge smile to my face, a huge voyage grin to my face, whatever scenario. And then also then the thing is\u2026 The bitcoin is like almost kind of imaginary. Like doesn\u2019t really exist anywhere in the physical realm, it only exists in cyberspace, your mind. So for example, if I want to prove to you my bitcoin balance I can just take out my phone or iPad and prove it to you immediately\u2026 So I guess this is the cool thoughts; now that I\u2019m super fucking rich and powerful and godlike glorious, I could just walk into any sort of Lamborghini or Ferrari or Porsche dealership, and just automatically assume and demand a test drive! And also the extreme joy, I could just handle and touch everything, and fuck with stuff, like I own it. Because I do. So once again, I think the hardest thing to think like an engineer is that at least for myself, I majored in sociology, always thought the engineering was like two math heavy, and was about following the rules. However, if you really think about real engineering, like building a bridge or making planes fly etc.\u2026 It is 100% rooted in physics and reality. The hard thing with ethics philosophy, as well as opinions, politics, sociology ethics etc. is that they are not focused on reality. Or nature. So for example, the fucking insanity of somehow allowing 12-year-old kids, have access to puberty blockers, hormone inhibitors, hormone amplifiers, etc.\u2026 At such a young age? Mother nature does not produce steroids or estrogen in pill or injection format naturally. The tricky thing is when people talk about nature\u2026 Like what is it that people really are talking about? Are they talking about like human nature, our DNA, our primordial being and nature? Or are we talking about like trees and stuff? Not really sure. Anyways, first principles first principles thinking. So the first line of things is kind of do like a hard reformat of the past and prior knowledge, and think things totally carte blanche, blank slate, white slate, black canvas, right now. Like if you just wiped the tablet clean, tabula rasa \u2014 how would you do things, right now, in the year 2024? For example\u2026 I\u2019m a huge fan of stick shift, the upsides of gasoline etc., and hybrid cars and Priuses, but the real truth is, if you somehow erased all the cars on the planet, today, and you somehow had to create automobiles and vehicles for all 8 billion of us right now\u2026 How would it and how should it look like? It would probably be like all self driving Teslas, obviously electric cars. I think the biggest problem about petroleum cars are tailpipe admissions. If you have ever been in local LA traffic or the 405 or the 10 during peak rush-hour when you see a car with that converter on, and you have your windows down and that insanely fucking toxic tailpipe chemicals are going straight into your lungs, You will actually know first hand, that the truth is this is obviously bad for your health. And the health of your kid and family and society. For example, imagine like you have a 1960s Camaro, without a catalytic converter. Would you allow it to run idle, in your garage with all the windows closed, with the tailpipe directly in the throat of your four-year-old child? Obviously not! So I think there are some simple practical things; First, tailpipe emissions are obviously 1 trillion times bad. Second, assuming that we all have nuclear vision or whatever, then electricity should practically be free. Then, Teslas and electric cars makes sense. Third also assuming that the Tesla super charging network is growing like a virus, the obvious thing thing is that it will continue to grow at an exponential rate. For example, it is very difficult to structurally build a gasoline station somewhere, but the only reason we keep using it is that it is already there, fast and convenient and cheap. But once again, if you started a totally brand new society in the middle of the desert, obviously it would probably be centered around electric cars and electric vehicles, as the upside of building a Tesla supercharger is very easy, Far easier than building anything else. Are you a demigod or a weakling? Simple bifurcation. So my personal understanding is that the reason why people seek refuge in the past is that it is an act of cowardice, only pussies are romantics. \ufffcI thought about this for a long time but what is it in fact, the history of the word \u201cromance, and why do they call it \u201cromantic\u201d? \ufffc\ufffc\ufffc Thank God for ChatGPT. They said you talked about how the notion was \u201cromanz\u201d\u2013 essentially it were works that are created in the romance language languages, like Italian Spanish French etc. Anything that was not Latin. But the problem about this movement is that it emphasized concepts and ideas that were quite degenerate in nature. For example, over excessive feelings, I think the medieval literature of knightly chivalry etc. to be \u201cgallant\u201d\u2013 even the Vietnamese have a term \u201cgallant\u201d\u2013 like when you\u2019re opening a door for a woman to get out of a taxi, just like a knight who takes off his robe to cover a puddle to let a woman walk across it? People don\u2019t really give it a second thought\u2026 \ufffc everyone assumes that to be romantic is a good thing? Like somehow this fucking insane idea I spent six months of your salary to buy your fianc\u00e9 a diamond wedding ring, which is just a fake commodity.

And also wore the wise; if you\u2019re planning on getting married or engaged or whatever\u2026 Never spend more than $300 on a wedding ring. Bitcoin is like your new cyber estate. The other day I saw a new funny Zen Wabisabi minimalist hipster house, one of those really cool new three-story teepees they build on a small plot of land listed for $4.4 million.

I\u2019m very interesting thing I learned from Michael Saylor about the history of science is that the reason why most cars and vehicles are the width it is today is that it is simply based off of the size of the rails that the ancient Romans did for her roads; All roads lead to Rome. I think people are starting to wake up\u2026 They\u2019re starting to realize that their Dogecoin, Shiba Inu coin, memecoins, altcoins, ethereum, chainlink etc aren\u2019t actually worth anything. Naturally, Wu-Wei \u2014 all of the weaker currencies and assets shall flow into the stronger ones. What that means is your already seeing it, I\u2019m Exodus in a flight from Ethereum into bitcoin, which is like 1 trillion times better sexier cooler more desirable stronger and superior in every sort of way. For example, would you rather be driving the old Volkswagen Passat, or the cybertruck on steroids? \ufffc Or, would you rather have the horse and buggy, or would you rather have the Rolls-Royce the Bentley or the Lexus LS? Fully loaded LS\u2019s,,, ah yes! \u2013 JAY Z \ufffc one of my great happinesses is that I did not formally study economics. Why is it such a good thing? I also never studied business, another good thing. The reason is all the old models are wrong, and whenever we simply try to copy the past models, we will not succeed in massively because true successes are carte Blanche, insanely awesome. For example, it seems now that Tesla in Nvidia was such obvious investing decisions, or like buying Apple in the 1980s. Or buying Google or Amazon or even Microsoft in the early days. Now, if I could tell you that there is this thing or company or concept \ufffc Fan is actually in fact like 1 million times more valuable than Apple Amazon Facebook google etc.\u2026 And that is gonna take over the whole planet, wouldn\u2019t you want to buy a piece of the pie? The big idea, if you were like in mainland China, even if you wanted to buy Apple Amazon Facebook etc., you couldn\u2019t because these are US American securities. With bitcoin, you can! It does not matter what your jurisdiction your country your thing is etc. If you are in Nairobi, Afghanistan, Shanghai, Beirut, the Netherlands whatever, anyone and everyone could purchase bitcoin. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s even clever ways you could do it in Cuba. Another interesting thought from Michael Saylor, considering that he studied history of science at MIT, which sounds like a very very good major, a good idea, maybe if Seneca gets into MIT and wants to study history of science, I\u2019ll send him. Anyways, Michael Saylor studied aeronautical engineering, and although he is a huge fan of Elon Musk he also is a bit critical; before we go to outer space, why not go into cyberspace instead? The notion cyber is actually super funny because it is kind of like an antiquated term; but as of late has become cool again. Like cyberpunk, cyber truck etc. Actually the funny thing was in the early 90s, when I was a kid, on AOL instant messenger, when you said \u201cWanna cyber?\u201d What is essentially sexual innuendo like do you wanna have sexy online erotic talk? Anyways, the reason why cyberspace seems to be a good field is that this is where all the economic energy power and warfare is heading. For example out of all the traditional job pats, cyber security seems to be the most important one, also \u201cpenetration testing\u201c. This is where the big money is. But beyond that, it is obviously bitcoin. Bitcoin is and will become the global monetary network, I\u2019m also certain we could even use bitcoin when we go to Mars. If you want to bring your wealth with you on a spaceship to the moon or Mars or whatever, it seems pretty obvious that you would probably Bring bitcoin. You\u2019re not going to take your square block in Manhattan or Culver City with you; you cannot take gold bars with you on a spaceship, nor can you bring Fiat currency, your JP Morgan Chase, your Lamborghini etc. The reason is because, once you have produced and created the bitcoin, it will last forever. There is nothing in the whole human universe that will last forever, as a result of physics and decay etc. But a bitcoin does. \ufffc\ufffc Buy happiness, buy Bitcoin! ERIC  When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING!

More Info Northvolt, Europe\u2019s big battery hopeful, has filed for bankruptcy in the United States after failing to turn its fortunes around as the electric vehicle market continues to disappoint fans. Northvolt has been struggling for a while now, with the Swedish government ruling out a bailout if it came to that. Sales have been problematic, costs have been high and BMW served a blow to the company when it pulled out of a $2-billion long-term battery cell contract saying Northvolt had failed to deliver the products on time.\n\n\n \u201cNorthvolt's liquidity picture has become dire,\u201d the company said in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing, as quoted by Reuters. The publication noted that Northvolt had just $ 30 million in cash, while its debt load stands at $5.8 billion. Still, Northvolt has managed to find $100 million in a loan for its restructuring, the company also said. The money comes from its biggest client, Swedish truck major Scania, which is also a shareholder in the company. The loan is meant to ensure battery cell production continues at the Swedish factory of Northvolt. Interestingly, Northvolt also said the bankruptcy protection process would not change its plans for a new battery cell factory in Canada. The Quebec facility, Northvolt said, \u201cwill continue to operate as usual outside of the Chapter 11 process,\u201d since it was financed separately from the parent company. Since its incenption, Northvolt has raised $15 billion from heavyweights such as Volkswagen, Siemens, JP Morgan, and BMW, on top of transition-related subsidies in both Europe and the United States. Yet the money ran out without Northvolt being able to show anything much for it.\n\n\n According to a Financial Times report from earlier this week, at least one investor in the company had written their investment off completely. The report also cited former Northvolt workers as saying that the company was plagued by problems, among which \u201ctrying to do too much, too fast.\u201d By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com Join the discussion | Back to homepage Previous Post Oil Prices Set for Weekly Gain as War Premium Jumps Next Post BP to Spend $7 Billion on Indonesia Gas Field With Carbon Capture \n\t            Irina is a writer for Oilprice.com with over a decade of experience writing on the oil and gas industry.\t           More Info China's Export Ban Sends Antimony Prices Soaring 40% in One Day Analysts Cut 2025 Oil Price Forecasts Again China's Oil Surplus Drops Dramatically Russian Refiners Cut Crude Processing as Hefty Losses Mount Saudi Arabia to Cut Oil Supply to China Amid Weak Demand ADVERTISEMENT Russia's War Economy Shows Signs of Strain Three Key Energy Moves Trump Plans for His First 100 Days OPEC+ Faces Double Trouble: China Demand Weakness and Trump\u2019s Policies The Future of Nuclear Power is Wrought with Challenges \n\n\n\n\n\n \u00a9 OilPrice.com The materials provided on this Web site are for informational and educational purposes only and are not intended to provide tax, legal, or investment advice.

Posted on 11\/19\/2024 5:37:04 AM PST by MtnClimber If you believe the messaging of the Trump transition, big cuts in U.S. government spending are coming. Announced cabinet appointments include several who are opponents of the mission of the agencies they will soon be heading. A new Department of Government Efficiency is to be created, headed by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, with instructions to take an ax to wasteful programs. But, assuming that some big cuts actually get implemented, you know what inevitably comes next: Because all government spending is (foolishly) counted as a 100% addition to GDP, the cuts first get recorded as a decline in GDP. Economists on the left (e.g., Krugman) then immediately scream that the cuts have failed, the country has gone into recession, and the people are suffering. In recent U.S. experience, the Republicans have never had the political fortitude to stay the course. But let\u2019s look at the latest news from Argentina. Argentine President Javier Milei was elected just over a year ago, on October 22, 2023. He then took office on December 10. The main thrust of his program was major cuts to government spending, and he immediately set to work to accomplish that. While I find it difficult to get comprehensive statistics in English, here are some notable data points: - An April 23, 2024 article in the Buenos Aires Times reported that, according to the Argentine Institute of Fiscal Analysis (IARAF), for the first quarter of 2024, \u201cprimary [government] expenses fell by 28.6 percent year-to-year in real terms (deducting inflation).\u201d- From the same piece: \u201cIARAF indicated that in the first three months of the year, 15 of 16 categories of spending were found to have declined in real terms, with the exception of universal social protection allowances (10.6 percent).\u201d- From a piece in Reason magazine, June 6, 2024: In March Milei had announced a cut of 70,000 employees from Argentina\u2019s public sector workforce; and by June, 25,000 of those job cuts had been accomplished. Then, in early June, \u201cArgentine President Javier Milei on Wednesday [June 5] announced the layoff of an additional 50,000 state employees, advancing his effort to \"reduce the state in half.\"- The result of the large spending cuts was that Argentina\u2019s fiscal balance had swung from large deficit to surplus in the course of mere months. From IARAF via the Buenos Aires Times: \u201c[For the first quarter of 2024] the primary deficit became a primary surplus of 625 billion pesos,\u201d wrote the IARAF. \u201cInterest expenses dropped by 31 percent in real terms from the same month last year. Consequently, a fiscal deficit turned into a 276-billion-peso fiscal surplus.\u201dThe inevitable immediate result of the large cuts to government spending was an official recession, as the government spending was removed from the official GDP accounts. From BBVA Research, October 2, 2024: [Argentine] GDP contracted by 3.4% in the first half of 2024.Trading Economics shows similar figures for Argentine GDP: -2.49% for 4Q 2023, -2.57% for 1Q 2024, and -1.7% for 2Q 2024. Actually, those declines were remarkably small given the very large cuts to government spending. Perhaps unnoticed to the statisticians, some entrepreneurial spirits were beginning to awaken among the Argentine people. And now, what\u2019s the latest from Argentina? It looks like the economy is starting to take off. From Mario Nawfal on X, November 16: ARGENTINA\u2019S ECONOMIC SURGE: JP MORGAN HIKES GDP GROWTH FORECAST TO 8.5% UNDER MILEI\u2019S POLICIES JP Morgan has raised Argentina\u2019s GDP growth forecast to 8.5%, citing optimism around recent reforms by President Milei. Milei, known for his bold free-market agenda, is pushing plans to dollarize Argentina\u2019s economy, slash public spending, and reduce government intervention \u2014 aiming to curb inflation and boost economic stability. This updated forecast signals rising confidence in Argentina\u2019s potential for a turnaround. Source: Buenos Aires Times.As of this writing it\u2019s still just a forecast. However, all indications are positive. Milei has stayed the course through a first year of strenuous opposition from entrenched interests. The dead hand of government overspending, over-regulation, crony capitalism and handouts has been dramatically loosened. Now it\u2019s up to Trump, Musk, Ramaswamy, et al., to follow the same course. May they have every success.\n\nTOPICS: Business\/Economy; Society\nKEYWORDS: argentina; cuts; doge; government; milei; spending\n\n\nNavigation: use the links below to view more comments.\nfirst 1-20,\u00a021-34 next last\n\n\n\n\n1\nposted on 11\/19\/2024 5:37:04 AM PST\nby MtnClimber\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: MtnClimber\n\nThe parasites in government are not going to cooperate voluntarily.\n\n2\nposted on 11\/19\/2024 5:37:21 AM PST\nby MtnClimber\n(For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 1\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: StAntKnee; texas booster\n\nManhattan Contrarian ping\n\n3\nposted on 11\/19\/2024 5:38:20 AM PST\nby MtnClimber\n(For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 1\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: MtnClimber\n\n    I've always felt like the GDP is a horrible barometer for the health of the economy.

But that is why we refer to them as \"parasites\".  No parasite ever voluntarily departs the host unless it has accomplished its goal, whatever that might be, laying of eggs, sucking it dry of nourishment, etc. or if its own survival is threatened by staying in place as a parasite.  In the case of the parasites infesting our government, they will not retire until they have enhanced their nest egg of retirement and pension, or until the government becomes bankrupt.  So we will have to treat real parasites both in and out of our government the same way we treat parasites in medicine, both human and veterinary.  We must destroy the parasites, figuratively speaking. If we can target them and make their parasitical environment too dangerous (professionally speaking, or legally speaking depending on what they have been doing since 2008) or uncomfortable (by causing them to actually work) causing them to self-evacuate from their host, that is the way to go.  If not, we take active action to destroy the parasites professionally by removing them from the host (our government, and our taxpayer dollars) against their will.  Some parasites cannot be removed without destroying the host. And like the image shown at the top, the Deep State, Democrats, and RINOs are going to tighten that tail encircling our necks to make us scream out in protest.\n\n11\nposted on 11\/19\/2024 6:08:31 AM PST\nby rlmorel\n(\"A people that elect corrupt politicians are not victims...but accomplices.\"  George Orwell)\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 2\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: MtnClimber\n\n    Also worth mentioning is when compared to the US dollar, the decline of the Argentinean peso has dropped sharply since Milei took office (ARS to USD Chart , https:\/\/archive.is\/8la0L).

We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.

There are a lot of things that are asinine about the way economics are reported.\nAnd they seem to change them on an ongoing basis, not to reflect best practices in reporting performance, but to provide the Leftist Deep State with cover, because the Left is usually the one that wants to alter the statistics to indicate success (Not that Republicans don\u2019t want the same, but how that manifests itself is probably different)\nI mean, I was shocked when I heard energy costs were excluded from the calculations of economy performance! I can\u2019t see how, in any world, that would provide the correct reflection of performance reality. It would be like cutting out food costs. Or housing costs.\nI pray that Trump is serious about not doing business as usual.

Argentine President Javier Milei was elected just over a year ago, on October 22, 2023. He then took office on December 10. The main thrust of his program was major cuts to government spending, and he immediately set to work to accomplish that. While I find it difficult to get comprehensive statistics in English, here are some notable data points: - An April 23, 2024 article in the Buenos Aires Times reported that, according to the Argentine Institute of Fiscal Analysis (IARAF), for the first quarter of 2024, \u201cprimary [government] expenses fell by 28.6 percent year-to-year in real terms (deducting inflation).\u201d- From the same piece: \u201cIARAF indicated that in the first three months of the year, 15 of 16 categories of spending were found to have declined in real terms, with the exception of universal social protection allowances (10.6 percent).\u201d- From a piece in Reason magazine, June 6, 2024: In March Milei had announced a cut of 70,000 employees from Argentina\u2019s public sector workforce; and by June, 25,000 of those job cuts had been accomplished. Then, in early June, \u201cArgentine President Javier Milei on Wednesday [June 5] announced the layoff of an additional 50,000 state employees, advancing his effort to \"reduce the state in half.\"- The result of the large spending cuts was that Argentina\u2019s fiscal balance had swung from large deficit to surplus in the course of mere months. From IARAF via the Buenos Aires Times: \u201c[For the first quarter of 2024] the primary deficit became a primary surplus of 625 billion pesos,\u201d wrote the IARAF. \u201cInterest expenses dropped by 31 percent in real terms from the same month last year. Consequently, a fiscal deficit turned into a 276-billion-peso fiscal surplus.\u201dThe inevitable immediate result of the large cuts to government spending was an official recession, as the government spending was removed from the official GDP accounts. From BBVA Research, October 2, 2024: [Argentine] GDP contracted by 3.4% in the first half of 2024.Trading Economics shows similar figures for Argentine GDP: -2.49% for 4Q 2023, -2.57% for 1Q 2024, and -1.7% for 2Q 2024. Actually, those declines were remarkably small given the very large cuts to government spending. Perhaps unnoticed to the statisticians, some entrepreneurial spirits were beginning to awaken among the Argentine people. And now, what\u2019s the latest from Argentina? It looks like the economy is starting to take off. From Mario Nawfal on X, November 16: ARGENTINA\u2019S ECONOMIC SURGE: JP MORGAN HIKES GDP GROWTH FORECAST TO 8.5% UNDER MILEI\u2019S POLICIES JP Morgan has raised Argentina\u2019s GDP growth forecast to 8.5%, citing optimism around recent reforms by President Milei. Milei, known for his bold free-market agenda, is pushing plans to dollarize Argentina\u2019s economy, slash public spending, and reduce government intervention \u2014 aiming to curb inflation and boost economic stability. This updated forecast signals rising confidence in Argentina\u2019s potential for a turnaround. Source: Buenos Aires Times.As of this writing it\u2019s still just a forecast. However, all indications are positive. Milei has stayed the course through a first year of strenuous opposition from entrenched interests. The dead hand of government overspending, over-regulation, crony capitalism and handouts has been dramatically loosened. Now it\u2019s up to Trump, Musk, Ramaswamy, et al., to follow the same course. May they have every success.\n\nTOPICS: Business\/Economy; Society\nKEYWORDS: argentina; cuts; doge; government; milei; spending\n\n\nNavigation: use the links below to view more comments.\nfirst 1-20,\u00a021-34 next last\n\n\n\n\n1\nposted on 11\/19\/2024 5:37:04 AM PST\nby MtnClimber\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: MtnClimber\n\nThe parasites in government are not going to cooperate voluntarily.\n\n2\nposted on 11\/19\/2024 5:37:21 AM PST\nby MtnClimber\n(For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 1\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: StAntKnee; texas booster\n\nManhattan Contrarian ping\n\n3\nposted on 11\/19\/2024 5:38:20 AM PST\nby MtnClimber\n(For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 1\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: MtnClimber\n\n    I've always felt like the GDP is a horrible barometer for the health of the economy.

In the case of the parasites infesting our government, they will not retire until they have enhanced their nest egg of retirement and pension, or until the government becomes bankrupt.

We must destroy the parasites, figuratively speaking. If we can target them and make their parasitical environment too dangerous (professionally speaking, or legally speaking depending on what they have been doing since 2008) or uncomfortable (by causing them to actually work) causing them to self-evacuate from their host, that is the way to go.

There are a lot of things that are asinine about the way economics are reported.\nAnd they seem to change them on an ongoing basis, not to reflect best practices in reporting performance, but to provide the Leftist Deep State with cover, because the Left is usually the one that wants to alter the statistics to indicate success (Not that Republicans don\u2019t want the same, but how that manifests itself is probably different)\nI mean, I was shocked when I heard energy costs were excluded from the calculations of economy performance! I can\u2019t see how, in any world, that would provide the correct reflection of performance reality. It would be like cutting out food costs. Or housing costs.\nI pray that Trump is serious about not doing business as usual.

He then took office on December 10. The main thrust of his program was major cuts to government spending, and he immediately set to work to accomplish that. While I find it difficult to get comprehensive statistics in English, here are some notable data points: - An April 23, 2024 article in the Buenos Aires Times reported that, according to the Argentine Institute of Fiscal Analysis (IARAF), for the first quarter of 2024, \u201cprimary [government] expenses fell by 28.6 percent year-to-year in real terms (deducting inflation).\u201d- From the same piece: \u201cIARAF indicated that in the first three months of the year, 15 of 16 categories of spending were found to have declined in real terms, with the exception of universal social protection allowances (10.6 percent).\u201d- From a piece in Reason magazine, June 6, 2024: In March Milei had announced a cut of 70,000 employees from Argentina\u2019s public sector workforce; and by June, 25,000 of those job cuts had been accomplished. Then, in early June, \u201cArgentine President Javier Milei on Wednesday [June 5] announced the layoff of an additional 50,000 state employees, advancing his effort to \"reduce the state in half.\"- The result of the large spending cuts was that Argentina\u2019s fiscal balance had swung from large deficit to surplus in the course of mere months. From IARAF via the Buenos Aires Times: \u201c[For the first quarter of 2024] the primary deficit became a primary surplus of 625 billion pesos,\u201d wrote the IARAF. \u201cInterest expenses dropped by 31 percent in real terms from the same month last year. Consequently, a fiscal deficit turned into a 276-billion-peso fiscal surplus.\u201dThe inevitable immediate result of the large cuts to government spending was an official recession, as the government spending was removed from the official GDP accounts. From BBVA Research, October 2, 2024: [Argentine] GDP contracted by 3.4% in the first half of 2024.Trading Economics shows similar figures for Argentine GDP: -2.49% for 4Q 2023, -2.57% for 1Q 2024, and -1.7% for 2Q 2024. Actually, those declines were remarkably small given the very large cuts to government spending. Perhaps unnoticed to the statisticians, some entrepreneurial spirits were beginning to awaken among the Argentine people. And now, what\u2019s the latest from Argentina? It looks like the economy is starting to take off. From Mario Nawfal on X, November 16: ARGENTINA\u2019S ECONOMIC SURGE: JP MORGAN HIKES GDP GROWTH FORECAST TO 8.5% UNDER MILEI\u2019S POLICIES JP Morgan has raised Argentina\u2019s GDP growth forecast to 8.5%, citing optimism around recent reforms by President Milei. Milei, known for his bold free-market agenda, is pushing plans to dollarize Argentina\u2019s economy, slash public spending, and reduce government intervention \u2014 aiming to curb inflation and boost economic stability. This updated forecast signals rising confidence in Argentina\u2019s potential for a turnaround. Source: Buenos Aires Times.As of this writing it\u2019s still just a forecast. However, all indications are positive. Milei has stayed the course through a first year of strenuous opposition from entrenched interests. The dead hand of government overspending, over-regulation, crony capitalism and handouts has been dramatically loosened. Now it\u2019s up to Trump, Musk, Ramaswamy, et al., to follow the same course. May they have every success.\n\nTOPICS: Business\/Economy; Society\nKEYWORDS: argentina; cuts; doge; government; milei; spending\n\n\nNavigation: use the links below to view more comments.\nfirst 1-20,\u00a021-34 next last\n\n\n\n\n1\nposted on 11\/19\/2024 5:37:04 AM PST\nby MtnClimber\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: MtnClimber\n\nThe parasites in government are not going to cooperate voluntarily.\n\n2\nposted on 11\/19\/2024 5:37:21 AM PST\nby MtnClimber\n(For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 1\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: StAntKnee; texas booster\n\nManhattan Contrarian ping\n\n3\nposted on 11\/19\/2024 5:38:20 AM PST\nby MtnClimber\n(For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 1\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: MtnClimber\n\n    I've always felt like the GDP is a horrible barometer for the health of the economy.

We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end.

But that is why we refer to them as \"parasites\".  No parasite ever voluntarily departs the host unless it has accomplished its goal, whatever that might be, laying of eggs, sucking it dry of nourishment, etc. or if its own survival is threatened by staying in place as a parasite.  In the case of the parasites infesting our government, they will not retire until they have enhanced their nest egg of retirement and pension, or until the government becomes bankrupt.  So we will have to treat real parasites both in and out of our government the same way we treat parasites in medicine, both human and veterinary.  We must destroy the parasites, figuratively speaking. If we can target them and make their parasitical environment too dangerous (professionally speaking, or legally speaking depending on what they have been doing since 2008) or uncomfortable (by causing them to actually work) causing them to self-evacuate from their host, that is the way to go.  If not, we take active action to destroy the parasites professionally by removing them from the host (our government, and our taxpayer dollars) against their will.  Some parasites cannot be removed without destroying the host. And like the image shown at the top, the Deep State, Democrats, and RINOs are going to tighten that tail encircling our necks to make us scream out in protest.\n\n11\nposted on 11\/19\/2024 6:08:31 AM PST\nby rlmorel\n(\"A people that elect corrupt politicians are not victims...but accomplices.\"  George Orwell)\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 2\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: MtnClimber\n\n    Also worth mentioning is when compared to the US dollar, the decline of the Argentinean peso has dropped sharply since Milei took office (ARS to USD Chart , https:\/\/archive.is\/8la0L).

In the case of the parasites infesting our government, they will not retire until they have enhanced their nest egg of retirement and pension, or until the government becomes bankrupt.

From IARAF via the Buenos Aires Times: \u201c[For the first quarter of 2024] the primary deficit became a primary surplus of 625 billion pesos,\u201d wrote the IARAF. \u201cInterest expenses dropped by 31 percent in real terms from the same month last year. Consequently, a fiscal deficit turned into a 276-billion-peso fiscal surplus.\u201dThe inevitable immediate result of the large cuts to government spending was an official recession, as the government spending was removed from the official GDP accounts. From BBVA Research, October 2, 2024: [Argentine] GDP contracted by 3.4% in the first half of 2024.Trading Economics shows similar figures for Argentine GDP: -2.49% for 4Q 2023, -2.57% for 1Q 2024, and -1.7% for 2Q 2024. Actually, those declines were remarkably small given the very large cuts to government spending. Perhaps unnoticed to the statisticians, some entrepreneurial spirits were beginning to awaken among the Argentine people. And now, what\u2019s the latest from Argentina? It looks like the economy is starting to take off. From Mario Nawfal on X, November 16: ARGENTINA\u2019S ECONOMIC SURGE: JP MORGAN HIKES GDP GROWTH FORECAST TO 8.5% UNDER MILEI\u2019S POLICIES JP Morgan has raised Argentina\u2019s GDP growth forecast to 8.5%, citing optimism around recent reforms by President Milei. Milei, known for his bold free-market agenda, is pushing plans to dollarize Argentina\u2019s economy, slash public spending, and reduce government intervention \u2014 aiming to curb inflation and boost economic stability. This updated forecast signals rising confidence in Argentina\u2019s potential for a turnaround. Source: Buenos Aires Times.As of this writing it\u2019s still just a forecast. However, all indications are positive. Milei has stayed the course through a first year of strenuous opposition from entrenched interests. The dead hand of government overspending, over-regulation, crony capitalism and handouts has been dramatically loosened. Now it\u2019s up to Trump, Musk, Ramaswamy, et al., to follow the same course.

But that is why we refer to them as \"parasites\".  No parasite ever voluntarily departs the host unless it has accomplished its goal, whatever that might be, laying of eggs, sucking it dry of nourishment, etc. or if its own survival is threatened by staying in place as a parasite.  In the case of the parasites infesting our government, they will not retire until they have enhanced their nest egg of retirement and pension, or until the government becomes bankrupt.  So we will have to treat real parasites both in and out of our government the same way we treat parasites in medicine, both human and veterinary.  We must destroy the parasites, figuratively speaking. If we can target them and make their parasitical environment too dangerous (professionally speaking, or legally speaking depending on what they have been doing since 2008) or uncomfortable (by causing them to actually work) causing them to self-evacuate from their host, that is the way to go.  If not, we take active action to destroy the parasites professionally by removing them from the host (our government, and our taxpayer dollars) against their will.  Some parasites cannot be removed without destroying the host. And like the image shown at the top, the Deep State, Democrats, and RINOs are going to tighten that tail encircling our necks to make us scream out in protest.\n\n11\nposted on 11\/19\/2024 6:08:31 AM PST\nby rlmorel\n(\"A people that elect corrupt politicians are not victims...but accomplices.\"  George Orwell)\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 2\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: MtnClimber\n\n    Also worth mentioning is when compared to the US dollar, the decline of the Argentinean peso has dropped sharply since Milei took office (ARS to USD Chart , https:\/\/archive.is\/8la0L).

But that is why we refer to them as \"parasites\".  No parasite ever voluntarily departs the host unless it has accomplished its goal, whatever that might be, laying of eggs, sucking it dry of nourishment, etc. or if its own survival is threatened by staying in place as a parasite.  In the case of the parasites infesting our government, they will not retire until they have enhanced their nest egg of retirement and pension, or until the government becomes bankrupt.  So we will have to treat real parasites both in and out of our government the same way we treat parasites in medicine, both human and veterinary.  We must destroy the parasites, figuratively speaking. If we can target them and make their parasitical environment too dangerous (professionally speaking, or legally speaking depending on what they have been doing since 2008) or uncomfortable (by causing them to actually work) causing them to self-evacuate from their host, that is the way to go.  If not, we take active action to destroy the parasites professionally by removing them from the host (our government, and our taxpayer dollars) against their will.  Some parasites cannot be removed without destroying the host. And like the image shown at the top, the Deep State, Democrats, and RINOs are going to tighten that tail encircling our necks to make us scream out in protest.\n\n11\nposted on 11\/19\/2024 6:08:31 AM PST\nby rlmorel\n(\"A people that elect corrupt politicians are not victims...but accomplices.\"  George Orwell)\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 2\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: MtnClimber\n\n    Also worth mentioning is when compared to the US dollar, the decline of the Argentinean peso has dropped sharply since Milei took office (ARS to USD Chart , https:\/\/archive.is\/8la0L).

We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just around the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means; it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now you begin to understand me.\u201d\n\u2015 George Orwell, 1984 The short version: It is all good. Right. There are a lot of things that are asinine about the way economics are reported. And they seem to change them on an ongoing basis, not to reflect best practices in reporting performance, but to provide the Leftist Deep State with cover, because the Left is usually the one that wants to alter the statistics to indicate success (Not that Republicans don\u2019t want the same, but how that manifests itself is probably different) I mean, I was shocked when I heard energy costs were excluded from the calculations of economy performance! I can\u2019t see how, in any world, that would provide the correct reflection of performance reality. It would be like cutting out food costs. Or housing costs. I pray that Trump is serious about not doing business as usual. His nominations for Cabinet officials indicate he is, and the wails of protests from the Left, RINO\u2019s and Deep State REALLY indicate they think he is.  The 300,000 plus government employees in the Wash, DC, area produce only restrictive paperwork.\n  Well. That sure does describe the Left to a \"T\".\n \n\nNavigation: use the links below to view more comments.\nfirst 1-20,\u00a021-34 next last\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n    Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual\n    posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its\n    management.

Two consecutive reductions in APM gas allocation for the CNG sector have resulted in pressure on the margins of CNG sales., according to Girishkumar Kadam, Senior Vice President & Group Head - Corporate Ratings, ICRA Limited.  \u201cNot only does this deal a severe blow, but now market is likely to build in more cuts,\u201d Nuvama Institutional Equities analysts said. They added that the recent APM de-allocation will affect 9\u201311 per cent of overall volumes due to replacement of cheap gas by costlier LNG, HPHT and new-well gas. Shares of city gas companies have been downgraded by analysts.  Kadam added, \u201cIn the near term, the demand will have to be met through spot LNG which is currently available at around $13-14\/mmbtu, and in the medium term through Term LNG or HPHT gas. With the current reduction, the APM gas availability for the CNG segment has fallen to 40-45 per cent of the demand vis-a-vis 70 per cent prior to the reduction in October 2024. To maintain the contribution margins at earlier levels CGD entities would have to increase the retail prices of CNG by about \u20b98.5-9.0\/kg.\u201d Global brokerages such as Jefferies and JP Morgan have also downgraded city gas stocks at a slashed target price. Jefferies has downgraded MGL and IGL to underperform, while JP Morgan has devalued MGL to neutral from overweight and IGL underweight. Nuvama has downgraded IGL, MGL to reduce rating after lowering near-term long-term margin and volume forecasts due to twin APM de-allocation. The brokerage has also downgraded GGL to \u2018hold\u2019 as it is least hurt by APM de-allocation due to lower priority sector volumes.\u00a0 JM Financial has maintained sell calls on IGL and MGL at a target price of \u20b9350 and \u20b91,100, respectively. However, the brokerage retained buy rating on Gujarat Gas at a lowered target price of \u20b9600. Emkay Global has downgraded IGL or MGL to reduce or add ratings at the target prices of \u20b9385 or \u20b91,400. Indraprastha Gas (IGL) shares plunged to close 19.84 per cent lower at \u20b9325.30.\u00a0 Mahanagar Gas (MGL) stock fell 14.04 per cent to \u20b91,128.35. Gujarat Gas (GGL) stock slumped 6.80 per cent on the NSE to close at \u20b9452.95.   Adani Total Gas (ATGL) shares declined 1.75 per cent to \u20b9671.90. ONGC shares closed flat at \u20b9250.90.

As is customary, my remarks are in my official capacity as Acting Director of the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff. Since 2021, Gurbir and I frequently discussed, including at conferences like this one, that we would prioritize restoring investor trust and confidence in the financial markets by emphasizing robust enforcement that works to promote a culture of compliance among market participants.[1] We explained that this included empowering frontline Enforcement staff by largely deferring to their judgment on various issues in our investigations and our recommendations to the Commission.[2] We explained that we would do this because Enforcement staff (i) are immensely talented and possess great experience and judgment and (ii) are in the best position to know the ins-and-outs of their investigations, the quality of their evidence, and the tenor and substance of interactions with defense counsel. We have done that. And I think the work of the Division over the past three-plus years has shown that our confidence in our Enforcement colleagues was well-placed. Enforcement staff have used their judgment wisely and appropriately, conducting investigations diligently, but with urgency, and without fear or favor, following the facts where they may lead, to protect investors across the industry. That is, after all, our mission, and this Commission and its Enforcement staff have endeavored to fulfill it on a daily basis. This has resulted in consequential enforcement actions addressing material misstatements by public companies,[3] wholesale failures by gatekeepers to comply with their professional obligations,[4] and failures by advisory firms to disclose and guard against conflicts of interest.[5]It has resulted in actions alleging that insiders abused their position for personal gain.[6] And, of course, it has resulted in actions alleging massive frauds by various types of market participants.[7] Those enforcement actions have protected innumerable investors, both by putting an end to the specific conduct at issue, but also by deterring other market participants who saw the Commission act forcefully and, in response, remediated their own violations or redoubled their efforts at compliance. Now, when Gurbir and I discussed our efforts to empower frontline Enforcement staff, there were some concerns in the defense bar that this would result in staff adopting unreasonable stances, or that good-faith efforts by market participants to comply would be disregarded. From my perspective, those concerns were misplaced. For one, Enforcement attorneys understand and appreciate the tremendous impact that an SEC investigation can have on parties that may find themselves in our crosshairs. Accordingly, giving process is part of the DNA of the Enforcement Division. For example, the Wells process remains a meaningful process for parties to make their arguments to the Enforcement Division, even without the Front Office participating in every meeting. As defense counsel that work with us regularly can attest, these meetings at times result in staff recommending reduced charges or even declining to recommend charges at all. The empowerment of Enforcement staff involved both carrots and sticks. Not only did we say we would largely defer to their judgment on charges, but more importantly, we told them to use their judgment in recommending that the Commission reward parties that self-policed, self-reported, remediated, or otherwise meaningfully cooperated with our investigations. Time and again, staff embraced our call on this point and asked Gurbir and me to consider those efforts by prospective defendants and respondents, and we, in turn, agreed to recommend resolutions to the Commission that imposed reduced penalties or even zero penalties.[8] Or, where parties have remediated the violations, we have taken that into account in determining what, if any, undertakings or other remedies to recommend. This has even included actions involving recidivists and major firms.[9] And it illustrates exactly what we mean by emphasizing robust enforcement while working to create or promote a culture of compliance among market participants. Because only by working together can we \u2013 that is, the regulator and the regulated \u2013 maintain investors\u2019 trust in the markets. Now, you may ask yourself, given the proactive remediation I just mentioned, why then do we need an Enforcement Division? Let me be clear. In my view, this is \u2013 indeed, it has to be \u2013 a joint undertaking where internal or in-house compliance complements the Commission\u2019s enforcement efforts. This is because self-regulation is not a substitute for regulatory enforcement. No matter how much we promote a culture of compliance; or message the benefits of self-policing, self-reporting, and proactive remediation; or even appeal to market participants\u2019 better nature, there will always be those who cut corners, those who choose non-compliance, either deliberately or by underinvesting in their compliance functions. The incentives are simply too great without a strong Enforcement Division holding such parties in check. After all, compliance has costs. There are the actual resources needed to implement effective compliance functions. And there are also the opportunity costs that may come from accurate disclosures, for example when disappointing financial figures drive investors elsewhere. But one need only look at the state of the securities market before the enactment of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for a sense of what happens when market participants are restrained only by their own judgment.[10] The marketplace therefore needs an Enforcement Division that is strong and that brings meaningful enforcement actions, actions that correct misbehavior before it spirals out of control and destroys investor wealth and investor confidence in the markets. In fact, we have telegraphed in clear terms that one of the ways we achieve compliance is by reversing the incentives, by imposing penalties and other remedies that make it clear to market participants that complying with the securities laws is cheaper than violating those laws.[11] Certainly, I am sure that it is not lost on anyone that the increased self-reporting and other cooperation that we have been highlighting has come during a time of record civil penalties. Those record penalties help incentivize companies to adequately invest in their compliance departments and empower their compliance personnel, which in turn protects investors and the markets. Ultimately, of course, protecting investors and promoting the integrity of the markets is what drives us all in the Division of Enforcement, and that should be a shared goal among all of us here. Securities law violations, whether they involve negligence, so-called \u201ctechnical violations,\u201d or deliberate intent to defraud, erode the integrity of the markets and undermine investor trust in our capital markets. It is therefore crucial that the Division of Enforcement have the ability to enforce compliance across the industry, addressing investor risk wherever and in whatever context it arises. Whether involving major global companies, small firms, or executive or senior officers. It is my hope that, going forward, we will continue to see respect for the investigative process and for the judgment of the professionals in the Division of Enforcement; that the Division will continue to operate as an effective watchman, ensuring that all market participants, across the industry, comply with their legal and regulatory obligations. The stakes are just too high for it to be otherwise. The continued success of our capital markets, which are the envy of the world and the engine of economic activity, depends on it. And, the trust of the average investor turns on it. Over the last three-plus years, the work of the Division, its staff, and the many market participants that have heeded our call to embrace our shared mission of protecting investors, has been a great source of pride for me, and I hope we can continue to build on that effort going forward.

The firm, which was set up by the one-time banker in 1976, was among a host of industrial holding companies on the Irish stock market at the time, including IWP International, James Crean and Fitzwilton. While the others would disappear over the next decade or so through break-ups and take-private deals \u2014 DCC would drop its Irish listing in 2013 for a sole quotation in London \u2014 the group has long stood out as an anomaly among Irish plcs, decades after global investors had tired of multi-industry groups and started to apply the dreaded \u201cconglomerate discount\u201d. Tommy Breen, who succeeded Flavin, set out a decade ago to simplify the investment case around DCC. He sold its food and beverage assets, including the Robert Roberts tea and coffee and Kelkin health foods brands, as well as a frozen and chilled foods logistics business in 2014, and its environmental unit, covering recycling and waste management, three years later. But now Breen\u2019s successor, Donal Murphy, has decided to finish the job, announcing plans on Tuesday to exit two of DCC\u2019s remaining businesses \u2014 healthcare and technology \u2014 to double down on energy. The board has hired investment bankers in JP Morgan to sell DCC Healthcare, which is made up of two businesses: DCC Vital, which sells medical products and devices to doctors and hospitals, and DCC Health & Beauty Solutions which focuses on developing and manufacturing nutritional supplements such as vitamin gummies and beauty products for brand owners. DCC has encountered challenges expanding the healthcare businesses in recent times through acquisition, coming up against private equity bidders willing to pay way more for deals. Murphy has concluded that if you can\u2019t beat them, you might as well sell to them. Analysts estimate the health unit could fetch as much as \u00a31.5bn, and the technology business, subject to Murphy hitting his maximum profit-boost target, up to a further \u00a31.6bn  The group has also called time on DCC Technology, which sells everything from audiovisual equipment for events companies to consumer electronics. However, Murphy reckons he can secure \u201ca substantial prize\u201d of as much as \u00a330 million (\u20ac36 million) in additional profits in this unit over the next 12 to 18 months through an operational improvement programme \u2014 before hoisting the \u201cfor sale\u201d sign. Analysts estimate the health unit could fetch as much as \u00a31.5 billion, and the technology business, subject to Murphy hitting his maximum profit-boost target, up to a further \u00a31.6 billion. He has pledged to return surplus cash to shareholders. DCC\u2019s share price market spiked by more than 17 per cent on Tuesday to a six-month high of over \u00a358 to give the company a market value of \u00a35.8 billion. It has held on to most of those gains. Analysts have cheered the development, with Deutsche Bank\u2019s David Brockton saying it was a \u201cbold decision\u201d that should push the stock higher as its complexity is reduced and investors remove a conglomerate discount \u2014 a tendency to value a diversified group of business below the sum of its parts. Jefferies number cruncher Ryan Flight described it as the \u201chard catalyst we have been waiting for\u201d to unlock value in the company. It\u2019s a decision that hasn\u2019t been taken lightly. DCC had long resisted pressure to simplify its story, arguing that being in multiple sectors reduced overall earnings volatility. It\u2019s served the group well as it has delivered an average of 14 per cent compound growth in operating profits since it floated 30 years ago. Still, the energy unit had been the standout success over the past decade, with compound average profit growth of 16.4 per cent. It now accounts for almost three-quarters of group earnings. Most of its profits have been coming from the sale of fossil fuels, including oil and gas for household heating and fuel pumped through its 1,175 petrol stations across Scandinavia, France, Britain and Ireland. However, stock market investors have been unwilling to buy into the green future that DCC Energy has been pushing in recent years. The complex structure of the group hasn\u2019t helped. Something had to give. DCC also plans to accelerate acquisitions in the market for liquid gas, which is seen as a transition fuel in the global trudge to net zero carbon emissions Aside from building out an offering of low-carbon renewable diesel and expanding its network of electric vehicle charge points, the company has also been actively acquiring solar panel and heat pump installation businesses. Murphy told analysts on Tuesday it aims to become a \u201cpan-European leader in solar solutions\u201d for households and businesses. \u201cThe new strategy will simplify the business and allow it to focus its annual M&A [merger and acquisition] spending of \u00a3300 million to \u00a3400 million into the energy segment,\u201d according to Fitch, the credit ratings agency. DCC also plans to accelerate acquisitions in the market for liquid gas, which is seen as a transition fuel in the global trudge to net zero carbon emissions. He highlighted the US profane market, where DCC only has a 1.5 per cent market share, as an obvious target. All told, its so-called green transition services, renewables and other businesses accounted for 35 per cent of DCC Energy\u2019s earnings last year, up from 22 per cent two years earlier. A further 42 per cent came from liquid gas. Goodbody Stockbrokers said DCC is now firmly in the \u201ccleantech wheelhouse\u201d. But with analysts pencilling in an average price target of close to \u00a370 for the stock \u2014 about 30 per cent above where it is trading \u2014 Murphy still has some convincing to do.

For Netflix, it is their biggest live sports event to date, and an opportunity to make sure it can handle audience demand with the NFL and WWE on the horizon. The bout between the YouTuber-turned-boxer Paul, and Tyson, 58-year-old former heavyweight champion, from AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, will stream globally and be available to Netflix's 280 million subscribers at no additional cost. Netflix will broadcast the bout in English, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, French and German. It was originally scheduled for July 20, but was delayed by Tyson having a medical episode on a plane and needing time to recover from a stomach ulcer. Netflix declined multiple requests by The Associated Press to make a company executive available to discuss expectations about the fight. JP Morgan Chase analyst Doug Anmuth has not wavered in his prediction that it will be the most-watched fight ever. That might be an unrealistic bar to climb since four of Muhammad Ali's bouts had estimated worldwide audiences of one billion. The modern-day U.S. mark of 4.6 million from the 2015 bout between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao could be attainable though. \u201cWe believe the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight could be the most watched boxing match ever given ease of access and NFLX\u2019s (Netflix's) large global subscriber base, and it should attract Ad Tier subs, viewers, and dollars,\" Anmuth said in his analyst note according to CNBC Pro. \"Netflix is increasingly focused on sports entertainment, events, and shoulder content, and we expect a bigger push into live sports over time, particularly as negotiating leverage shifts in NFLX\u2019s direction.\u201d Netflix has used live sports as support programming for documentaries and series it airs. \u201cCountdown: Paul vs. Tyson\u201d, a three-part documentary series previewing the fight card, was ranked second Thursday night among Netflix's most-viewed shows. Last November\u2019s Netflix Cup, where Formula 1 drivers were paired with PGA golfers in a match-play format, brought together famous figures from \u201cDrive to Survive\u201d and \u201cFull Swing,\u201d The March 3 Netflix Slam exhibition match between Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz tied in with \u201cPoint Break\" and a documentary series about Alcaraz that will air next year. The NFL elected to partner with Netflix for a Christmas Day doubleheader of games because two series \u2014 \u201cQuarterback\u201d and \u201cReceiver\u201d \u2014 were among Netflix\u2019s top 10 series globally. Most Valuable Promotions is handling the production of Friday's bout while CBS will produce the two NFL games for Netflix. When \u201cRaw\u201d begins airing on Netflix in January, World Wrestling Entertainment handles the production of all its events. Netflix will carry \u201cRaw\u201d in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Latin America beginning on Jan. 6, with additional countries to be added as contracts expire. The bigger component, though, is that Netflix will carry all of the company\u2019s shows overseas, including its premium live events like WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Royal Rumble. \u201cTechnically, it is a great dry run by putting on live events. The biggest problem they might have is you just end up in a situation where you\u2019ve got so much volume and viewing a way that you haven\u2019t had in the past,\u201d said Patrick Crakes, a media consultant and former Fox Sports executive. \u201cIt could end up being more than who watches the NFL games for a period of time. Others are handling the production, what they have to worry about is the operational flow. They know what they are doing.\u201d ___ AP sports: https:\/\/apnews.com\/sports Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In its order, SEBI stated that offering unlisted NCDs via private placement to more than 200 people should be classified as a public issue under the Companies Act, 2013. SEBI also noted that, prima facie, the structure employed by these platforms falls within the ambit of fraud as per Section 12A of the SEBI Act and Regulations 3 and 4(1) of the SEBI (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices Relating to the Securities Market) Regulations, 2003. The order further highlighted that these platforms made securities available for sale to the general public, rather than to a predefined group of investors. This practice violated the provisions of Section 42 of the Companies Act. Additionally, SEBI emphasized that the norms applicable to the public issuance of securities are equally enforceable for secondary market transactions. Advocate Mayura Maru, commenting on the order, said, \u201cWe have been continuously writing to SEBI about such platforms, as thousands of crores of public money have been raised in recent years. Regulating these platforms is crucial for protecting small investors. These platforms clearly violate various corporate laws related to the issuance of securities to the public and disclosure norms, similar to what we saw in the Sahara case. We hope that regulators take appropriate legal action to ensure that such dubious investment structures do not emerge in the future.\u201d SJVN Limited, a joint venture between the Government of India and Himachal Pradesh, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Energy Department of Rajasthan to develop 7 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy projects in the state. The shares of SJVN Limited were trading at \u20b9107.90 up by \u20b94.46 or 4.31 per cent on the NSE today at 11.15 am. Tata Power shares trade flat on the NSE at \u20b9412.05. Company had signed pact with Asian Development Bank (ADB) to evaluate financing worth USD 4.25 billion for its several strategic projects. A memorandum of understanding has been signed with ADB at Baku, Azerbaijan, Tata Power said in a statement. Power generation increased slightly by 1.1% YoY to 468BU in Q2FY25, as lower cooling demand during the Monsoon season softened demand for power, leading to a 5% YoY decline in peak demand to 231GW and a 250bp drop in the coal-based plant load factor (PLF) to 64.8%. Renewable energy (RE) capacity expansion is gaining traction, driven by the government\u2019s target of 500GW by FY32, with major firms like JSW Energy, NTPC, Tata Power, CESC, and Torrent Power announcing significant RE projects under construction or in the pipeline. Power demand is set to post a 7% CAGR through FY32E, spurring investment in capacity addition, storage solutions, and transmission infrastructure to support growing renewables integration and energy security. Power generation increases during the Monsoon quarter: Power generation increased 1.1% YoY to 468BU in Q2FY25. Lower cooling demand resulted in weak power demand. Peak demand declined 5% YoY to 231GW. PLF of coal-based plants deteriorated 250bp to 64.8% in Q2FY25. Major firms announce ambitious renewables capacity plans: Given the government\u2019s target of achieving 500GW RE by FY32 and cost competitiveness, RE capacity addition in the renewables space is gaining traction. JSW Energy constitutes 7.3GW of RE projects under construction and 3.5GW of RE projects in the pipeline. NTPC plans to add 16GW of RE capacity in the next three years. Tata Power has 6447MW projects under construction. CESC has a 3GW hybrid portfolio in the pipeline. For Torrent Power, 3GW RE capacity is under construction.

The bridal jewellery pre-booking numbers are also quite encouraging due to our rate protection scheme.\u00a0 We expect a robust bridal jewellery season better than that of last fiscal year.\u00a0 During the four-month period from November to February in the previous fiscal year, bridal jewellery contributed \u20b93,923 crore, accounting for approximately 35% of our total revenue of \u20b911,210 crore during that four-month period. The ongoing transition of bridal jewellery designs captures the evolving sensibilities and choices of new-age brides. Brides across regions want their jewellery to reflect grace, poise and individuality. Be it chokers, necklace, naths, maang tikka or sheshpatti \u2013 each element of the bridal jewellery ensemble needs to be innovation-driven and design-enriched to capture the imagination of the modern-day brides.\u00a0 That\u2019s why along with traditional gold necklace now coexists layered and delicate necklaces accentuated with diamond or precious stones. Both timeless tradition and modernity are adding to the fluidity of the contemporary bridal jewellery design canvas.\u00a0 Through our immensely successful bridal jewellery campaign Brides of India, we have managed to develop a stronger connect with brides across regions and as per our findings, gold is now accentuated or combined with the playfulness of precious stones or diamonds to get the desired look \u2013 be it necklaces, earring, etc. A section of brides has been showing preference for polki, emeralds to exude individuality.\u2019\u2018 Bank Nifty began today\u2019s session at 50,513 versus previous session\u2019s close of 50,373. The index is currently hovering around 50,680, up 0.6 per cent. The advance\/decline ratio stands at 8\/4, a positive indication. Bank of Baroda, up 2.6 per cent, is the top performer whereas The Federal Bank, down about 1 per cent, is the top loser. Nifty PSU Bank has appreciated 1.8 per cent whereas Nifty Private Bank is up 0.3 per cent. So, broadly, the public sector banks are outperforming the private peers. Read more here. Crop-protection chemical producer UPL Limited\u2019s (UPL) proposed equity raise through a rights issue and sale of minority stake in a subsidiary will improve its leverage profile, Fitch Ratings says. However, further deleveraging through a strong rebound in EBITDA will most likely drive the ratings of subsidiary UPL Corporation Limited (UPL Corp, BB\/Negative), which are aligned with UPL\u2019s consolidated credit profile. The pace of UPL\u2019s EBITDA recovery remains uncertain, due to risk from manufacturing overcapacity in China. Equity benchmarks opened higher on Friday, recovering from the previous day\u2019s sharp decline triggered by bribery allegations against Gautam Adani, with financial stocks leading the gains amid positive global cues. Sensex opened higher at 77,349.74 from its previous close of 77,155.79 and has continued to advance, trading at 77,459.18 as of 9.50 AM, up by 303.39 points or 0.39 per cent. Nifty opened at 23,411.80 against its previous close of 23,349.90 and is currently at 23,439.00, gaining 89.10 points or 0.38 per cent. Rupee opened on a flat note and rose just 3 paise from its all-time low level to 84.47 against the US dollar in morning trade on Friday, as the support of positive domestic equities was negated by geopolitical pressures and unabated foreign portfolio outflows. The US dollar strengthened in the overseas market and Brent oil continued to move up as fighting between Ukraine and Russia continued to gain investors\u2019 attention. Zinka Logistics made a positive debut on the stock market, listing at Rs 280, a 2.89% premium over its issue price of Rs 273. This was a better-than-expected performance, considering the moderate subscription of 1.87 times and the lackluster pre-listing sentiment reflected in the zero GMP. The company\u2019s strong network effects and position as a leading platform in the logistics industry have likely contributed to the positive listing. However, investors should remain cautious due to the company\u2019s past financial challenges, including losses and negative cash flow, and the ongoing legal challenges. While the positive listing is encouraging, it\u2019s crucial for investors to conduct thorough due diligence and assess the company\u2019s long-term growth prospects.

A U.S. indictment of three board representatives of an unrated Adani group entity could affect investor confidence in other Adani group entities (because the founder is on the board of multiple entities within the group), thereby potentially impairing their funding access and increasing their funding costs. U.S. prosecutors allege that the board members are involved in a US$250 million bribery scheme related to solar power contracts in India, and that they breached the anti-bribery compliance policy through misrepresentation to investors in an offshore bond (unrated). In our view, this could further raise questions regarding the management and governance of various Adani group entities. The indictment is independent of, but follows, a short seller report that led to investigation by Indian Supreme Court and India\u2019s capital market regulator. Because of the potential impact across the wider Adani Group, we revised to negative the outlook on Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd. (Adani Electricity) and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. (Adani Ports). We also affirmed our \u2018BBB-\u2019 ratings on these entities. Project finance entity Adani Green Energy Ltd. Restricted Group 2 (AGEL RG2) is a subsidiary of Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL), the entity linked to the allegations. Although it is ringfenced from the parent, we revised to negative the outlook on AGEL RG2 and affirmed our \u2018BB+\u2019 issue rating. The negative outlook on these entities indicates that, in our view, their cash flows could be materially affected if their funding access weakens, their funding costs rise significantly, or the allegations are proven, in addition to our assessment of their governance and business profiles. Our rating on North Queensland Export Terminal Pty Ltd. (NQXT) already captures refinancing risk for maturities due in 2025; therefore, we affirmed the \u2018BB\u2019 issue rating on NQXT and the outlook remains stable. Similarly, Adani International Container Terminal Private Ltd. (AICTPL) is not exposed to refinancing risk or significant foreign exchange risk, so we affirmed our \u2018BBB-\u2019 issue rating on AICTPL and the outlook remains stable. Majority of Adani Group stocks dip further for the second day. Catch all the live action here.\u00a0 Shares of Zinka Logistics Solutions will be listed at the bourses on Friday following a successful IPO. The company has fixed the IPO price as \u20b9273, at the upper end of the price band \u20b9259-273. The IPO was receiving subdued investors\u2019 interest but sailed through due to late hour bidding by institutional investors.\u00a0 The IPO was subscribed 1.86 times.\u00a0 Crude oil futures traded higher on Friday morning due to the escalation in hostilities between Russia and Ukraine.

Comment by Viswajit Srinivasan, a senior banker of Indian origin based out of UK, who specialises in sustainable finance and energy transition on Tata Power\u2019s collaboration for a $4.5 bn investment with ADB  The MoU signed between the Tata Group and ADB with the backdrop of COP29 represents yet another example of confidence being reposed in investing in the Indian renewables sector. It is unclear what the nature of support from ADB would be as part of this strategic partnership and whether there would be an element of subsidy or grant funding involved in specific financing proposals that form part of the scope of investments. The range of investments targeted include more mature segments such as solar and wind projects as well as battery storage projects ; with additional support for upgradation of distribution networks of Tata Power, this MoU would likely help build new renewable infrastructure, modernise existing infrastructure and help India inch closer towards meeting sustainability and Net Zero. Renewable energy contributes ~ 45% of overall installed electricity generation capacity and India\u2019s power demand is projected to grow at 8%+ over the next 12 months and this investment reflects the growing interest in opportunities available in India for patient capital. U.S. stocks closed higher Thursday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average leading the gains for the three major equity indexes. Optimism around year-end, especially around consumers fueling another crucial holiday-shopping season, helped lift stocks, as did strong earnings from AI-darling Nvidia Corp. Natural-gas futures rallied Thursday to trade 18% higher this week so far, and almost at a year high buoyed by forecasts for colder U.S. weather as the recent Russia-Ukraine escalation and risks of attacks on energy infrastructure stoked fears of disruptions to gas flows. Bitcoin prices were powering higher on Thursday, getting a boost after Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said he would exit his post in January. Bitcoin, the world\u2019s biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, was last up about 5.7% on Thursday to about $98,790, according to CoinMarketCap. Goldman Sachs has forecast India\u2019s GDP growth to slow to 6.3% year-on-year in 2025, citing the continued fiscal consolidation and slower credit growth due to macro-prudential measures by the Reserve Bank of India as key reasons. The brokerage firm noted that despite this expected slowdown, India\u2019s long-term structural growth prospects remain strong.\u00a0 Asian equities mostly rose Friday following gains on Wall Street as investors shook off initial concerns over Nvidia Corp.\u2019s revenue outlook. Indian stock indices experienced a significant decline on Nov 21, pressured by bribery charges against Gautam Adani, which weakened already fragile investor sentiment amid unfavourable global conditions. Nifty finally ended the day with the losses of 169 points or 0.72% at 23349.90 levels. Nifty is in continuation of a down trend. Support for the Nifty is seen in the band of 23150-23200, while immediate resistance is seen at 23500. The Adani Group saw its sharpest decline since the Hindenburg controversy, with a \u20b92.2 lakh crore loss in market cap. Adani Enterprises plunged 23%, while Adani Ports dropped 14%. GQG Partners, holding stakes between 1.5% and 2% in six Adani companies as of September 2024, is under scrutiny. NTPC Green Energy\u2019s IPO was 88% subscribed on day two, while exit polls predict a BJP-led Mahayuti win in Maharashtra and Jharkhand. Nifty is poised for further downside as FIIs continue their sell-off, unloading \u20b939,669 crore in November. Bearish sentiment remains strong on stocks like SRF, Bajaj Finance, and Voltas.

Kennedy has faced widespread criticism for his baseless claims  that some vaccines are not safe and effective and that they\u2019re linked to autism. He has said that he will institute a purge at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and that he will remove fluoride from the public water supply and take measures to limit ultra-processed food.   Shares in both pharmaceuticals  and biotech fell \u2013 the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF fell over four percent during morning trading,  Reuters  noted.   Packaged food and beverage companies, such as Pepsi and Coca-Cola, also saw their shares take a downturn.   But the worst effect was seen among makers of vaccines, whose shares initially fell on Thursday and continued to do so on Friday. Moderna saw a seven percent dip just a day after seeing its lowest since April 2020. Meanwhile, Pfizer dropped almost four percent and Novavax was down two percent.   Analysts at the investment firm Jefferies Group wrote that \u201cThe point is around sentiment, stance and perspective \u2013 that impacts biotech investors\u2019 view of how FDA and other HHS issues will evolve (ie not accelerating drugs and pro-biotech).\u201d   Similarly, major operators in the European pharma market also saw the effects of Kennedy\u2019s nomination to the top health job in the largest drug market in the world.   In Germany, Pfizer\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine partner BioNtech dropped over 10 percent, set to be its largest one-day drop since August. Its stock in the US tumbled almost five percent. GSK saw their shares go down almost four percent and French drugmaker Sanofi lost 3.6 percent.   A large supplier of biotech lab gear and substances, Sartorious, saw their shares drop by 3.8 percent, while mpox vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic dropped 16 percent as it was also harmed by its results in the third quarter.   The CEO of the Danish firm shared worries that Kennedy\u2019s nomination could lead to an increase in vaccine skepticism. However, he also told Reuters  that the American response to the pandemic during Trump\u2019s first stint in the White House made him confident that there would be future bio-defense funding.   Analysts at JP Morgan Chase wrote: \u201cWe are not surprised the sector has been under pressure on the potential for RFK Jr. having oversight of the various agencies within HHS (including the FDA, the CDC, NIH, and Medicare\/Medicaid) given his previous stated views on the industry.\u201d   A number of medical scientists shared their concerns on Friday that vaccination efforts could suffer.   RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said Kennedy\u2019s nomination could have \u201cfar-reaching and difficult-to-project implications for the biotechnology sector, adding a considerable layer of uncertainty and challenging investability,\u201d according to Reuters  .   Meanwhile, shares in Novo Nordisk, the obesity drugmaker, saw its shares drop 4.3 percent while shares in Eli Lilly, the US drugmaker, dropped four percent.   Ozempic, the Novo Nordisk drug often prescribed for weight loss, has faced criticism from Kennedy, arguing that it put the focus on the symptoms of the obesity crisis instead of taking actions to create a better food system.   Kennedy has also argued for removing ultra-processed foods from school lunches to combat chronic diseases.   Several packaged food giants, such as Hershey, General Mills, Conagra Brands, and Kraft Heinz, all decreased more than three percent, while shares in Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage, and Keurig Dr Pepper dropped between one and four percent.

The teacher was reportedly trying to help the bat escape without harming it. Rather than calling animal control, she attempted to bring it outside on her own.  Patients in the West Midlands, including some of those suffering heart attacks, are being asked to get themselves to hospital amid worsening pressures on ambulance services this winter. The West Midlands Ambulance Service has advised its 999 call handlers to ask patients if they can make their own way to the hospital when services are under high demand. According to reports in The Sunday Times a memo was sent to staff explaining the change was needed due to delays in patients getting an ambulance.

It was November 3, two days before the presidential election. Fisher\u2019s 16-year-old non-binary son, who uses he\/they pronouns, was part of an online suicide pact with three other transgender and non-binary teens in Florida, Alabama and Tennessee.

At just 15 years old, Symon\u00e9 underwent her first of two breast reduction surgeries \u2014 a decision heavily influenced by the adults around her. \u201cI went from a triple D all the way down to a B.

He never found Fenn\u2019s fortune, a pirate\u2019s treasure chest of gold coins and jewels buried for a decade.

A mother-daughter pair of election workers last month accused the former New York City mayor of violating a court order that blocks him from repeating anything that resembles his defamatory remarks about them. The women asked the judge overseeing a defamation case in Washington, DC to consider holding him in contempt in their last-ditch effort to stop...

Nearly 400 Boeing employees were laid off in Washington state and more than 500 in California, news outlets reported Monday.

CEO Kelly Ortberg has said the strike did not cause the layoffs, which he...  U.S. prosecutors are accusing two senior Syrian officials of overseeing a notorious torture center that abused peaceful protesters, including a 26-year-old American woman who was later believed to have been executed. The indictment was released Monday, two days after a shock rebel offensive overthrew Syrian President Bashar Assad . The U.S., U.N. and others accuse him of widespread human rights abuses in a 13-year battle to crush opposition forces seeking his removal from power.

The Denver City Council\u2019s Safety, Housing, Education and Homelessness Committee on Wednesday will consider adding $500,000 to a contract with Denver Rescue Mission to manage chronically homeless clients.

Donald Trump criticized former President Barack Obama while wading into the ongoing Syria conflict on Saturday, saying the U.S. should not get involved nor should it have ever inserted itself in the matter.

When the CEO of one of the largest medical insurance companies in the United States was gunned down on the street in Midtown Manhattan on Wednesday, his death quickly turned into a larger conversation about the much-reviled industry in which he worked. Brian Thompson, a 50-year-old father of two, had been in New York City for a conference when he was killed in what police believe was a targeted shooting. Among hundreds of posts on social media about the shocking murder, many people were moved to talk about the injustice of the health insurance industry. Often the dark jokes...

When the CEO of one of the largest medical insurance companies in the United States was gunned down on the street in Midtown Manhattan on Wednesday, his death quickly turned into a larger conversation about the much-reviled industry in which he worked. Brian Thompson, a 50-year-old father of two, had been in New York City for a conference when he was killed in what police believe was a targeted shooting.

Kennedy has faced widespread criticism for his baseless claims  that some vaccines are not safe and effective and that they\u2019re linked to autism. He has said that he will institute a purge at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and that he will remove fluoride from the public water supply and take measures to limit ultra-processed food.   Shares in both pharmaceuticals  and biotech fell \u2013 the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF fell over four percent during morning trading,  Reuters  noted.   Packaged food and beverage companies, such as Pepsi and Coca-Cola, also saw their shares take a downturn.   But the worst effect was seen among makers of vaccines, whose shares initially fell on Thursday and continued to do so on Friday. Moderna saw a seven percent dip just a day after seeing its lowest since April 2020. Meanwhile, Pfizer dropped almost four percent and Novavax was down two percent.   Analysts at the investment firm Jefferies Group wrote that \u201cThe point is around sentiment, stance and perspective \u2013 that impacts biotech investors\u2019 view of how FDA and other HHS issues will evolve (ie not accelerating drugs and pro-biotech).\u201d   Similarly, major operators in the European pharma market also saw the effects of Kennedy\u2019s nomination to the top health job in the largest drug market in the world.   In Germany, Pfizer\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine partner BioNtech dropped over 10 percent, set to be its largest one-day drop since August. Its stock in the US tumbled almost five percent. GSK saw their shares go down almost four percent and French drugmaker Sanofi lost 3.6 percent.   A large supplier of biotech lab gear and substances, Sartorious, saw their shares drop by 3.8 percent, while mpox vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic dropped 16 percent as it was also harmed by its results in the third quarter.   The CEO of the Danish firm shared worries that Kennedy\u2019s nomination could lead to an increase in vaccine skepticism. However, he also told Reuters  that the American response to the pandemic during Trump\u2019s first stint in the White House made him confident that there would be future bio-defense funding.   Analysts at JP Morgan Chase wrote: \u201cWe are not surprised the sector has been under pressure on the potential for RFK Jr. having oversight of the various agencies within HHS (including the FDA, the CDC, NIH, and Medicare\/Medicaid) given his previous stated views on the industry.\u201d   A number of medical scientists shared their concerns on Friday that vaccination efforts could suffer.   RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said Kennedy\u2019s nomination could have \u201cfar-reaching and difficult-to-project implications for the biotechnology sector, adding a considerable layer of uncertainty and challenging investability,\u201d according to Reuters  .   Meanwhile, shares in Novo Nordisk, the obesity drugmaker, saw its shares drop 4.3 percent while shares in Eli Lilly, the US drugmaker, dropped four percent.   Ozempic, the Novo Nordisk drug often prescribed for weight loss, has faced criticism from Kennedy, arguing that it put the focus on the symptoms of the obesity crisis instead of taking actions to create a better food system.   Kennedy has also argued for removing ultra-processed foods from school lunches to combat chronic diseases.   Several packaged food giants, such as Hershey, General Mills, Conagra Brands, and Kraft Heinz, all decreased more than three percent, while shares in Coca-Cola, Monster Beverage, and Keurig Dr Pepper dropped between one and four percent.

A McDonald\u2019s employee in Altoona, Pennsylvania, saw 26-year-old Luigi Mangione eating a meal inside the restaurant that morning and thought he matched images of the suspected gunman.

One conclusion they are confident of, however: It was a targeted attack, not a random one.

I\u2019ve heard that\u2026the issue of the Parthenon Sculptures has kind of resurfaced, following yesterday\u2019s publication in The Economist, and that 2025 could be a year of significant progress, if not breakthroughs, in the Athens-British Museum negotiations. The issue will come up during the first one-on-one meeting between Kyriakos Mitsotakis and the new UK Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, which will take place in early December at 10 Downing Street. The most likely date for this meeting is December 2nd, and preparations for the meeting have already been discussed in London between Giorgos Gerapetritis and his new counterpart, David Lammy. The general feeling is that with the current government, we can communicate, unlike with the indescribable Sunak, who put on a show when he met with K.M. Hopefully. Mitsotakis-Sakellaropoulou Chit-Chat A lot may be said about the Presidency of the Republic, but K.M. and Sakellaropoulou still maintain a good personal chemistry. At yesterday\u2019s event for the Justice Ministry\u2019s performance report, the two sat next to each other in the front row, and during the screening of an introductory video, when the model of the new Judicial Building of Piraeus appeared, K.M. turned to the President, whispering, \u201cIt will be very nice,\u201d to which she nodded in agreement, and they had a brief exchange. Kasselakis wow Well, before I get to the highlights of the day, which are none other than yesterday\u2019s collectible SYRIZA debate, I\u2019d like to comment on the last two statements made by \u201cplain Stefanos,\u201d which I think\u2026speak for themselves when it comes to Kasselakis. One time, he told us that the SYRIZA people and Tsipras had deceived everyone during the infamous interview about Mati\u2014namely, that they knew about the dead\u2014and the next moment, he said that the referendum, the capital controls, and their handling in general were a disgrace for the party. Nice Stefanos, huh? Personally, among the names suggested for Stefanos\u2019s party, I prefer \u201cWe,\u201d because we\u2019ll already have the party anthem, the old hit by Remo. Because the president is into light pop music, loves the night and all the fun, right? Come on, the morning talk shows are falling apart too. SYRIZA \u2013 Deep Sleep Look, as for the picture from yesterday\u2019s SYRIZA debate, we got a bit bored, come on, without Kasselakis and with a polished Polakis, what are we even talking about? The only one still showing some pulse is Apostolos, who reminds us a bit of the caf\u00e9 that we all got to know and love, after a certain point of course, when we had managed to escape. Well, as for Apostolos, the wind turbines still don\u2019t have (yet) batteries, for Pavlos, we should nationalize the National Bank (although this is not provided for in the EU, nor by the SSM), and we should take over the Hellenic Petroleum, not Motor Oil, since the boss there has a heavier hand, huh? On PPC, both Famelos and Polakis agree we should take it back, because until 2019, we didn\u2019t manage to bankrupt it, we narrowly avoided it. Basically, it\u2019s the same as always, these people say things that simply can\u2019t happen, or if they tried again, we\u2019d end up back in the memoranda within months. But listen, although these people were a bit boring, they had decent appearances, a good atmosphere among them, and a level of civility that we hadn\u2019t seen in their previous \u201cgatherings.\u201d Well, after all, they\u2019re leftists, they\u2019ll throw in something somewhat irrelevant to avoid looking like Mitsotakis. Clearly, the winners and favorites were Famelos and Polakis. The Government\u2019s Plan for Debt Payments The submission of the 2025 Budget to Parliament reveals the overall plan of the Public Debt Management Agency (ODDIH) for the early repayment of the country\u2019s old high-interest loans. Starting next month and until December next year, ODDIH will repay 13 billion euros of debt early. In the following year, until December 2026, a total of 18 billion euros will be paid off. For all of this to happen, approval must be granted by Luxembourg, and the ESM must formally approve Athens\u2019 request to use the \u201chard cushion\u201d of 15 billion euros for the early repayment of expensive loans from the first Memorandum. The 15 billion euros will be divided into three parts: This year, 5 billion euros will be paid, and along with an additional 3 billion euros from the state\u2019s cash reserves, three annual installments of bilateral loans from the first memorandum will be paid off. The next part of 5 billion euros will repay intergovernmental loans within 2025. The third and final part of 5 billion will be used in 2026. This means that this year, the country\u2019s Public Debt will drop below 357 billion euros. This way, the issue of the mandatory accounting of deferred interest will also be addressed. The debt-to-GDP ratio will fall to 153-154%, with a decrease compared to the highs of 2020 reaching 55 percentage points (or 60 points by the end of 2025, when further reduction of the ratio is expected, even below 149%, especially if good fiscal results continue). Meanwhile, if the sky doesn\u2019t fall on our heads, we\u2019ll also see upgrades from the Credit Rating Agencies. At Fortress, Sfakianakis\u2019 Loans The Sfakianakis Group reported improved financial performance for last year, while there have also been developments regarding its loans, which have now all been transferred to Fortress. Let\u2019s start with the good news: the group\u2019s sales (that is, \u201cSfakianakis S.A.\u201d) in 2023 amounted to 474.6 million euros, an increase of 35.1%, compared to 351 million euros in 2022. As noted, the results were primarily affected by the increase in car sales, particularly in the Suzuki sector and retail, as well as short-term and long-term leasing. EBITDA for the Group amounted to 91.8 million euros, compared to 58.1 million in 2022, up 57.9%. Furthermore, pre-tax profits increased to 40 million euros, compared to 12.2 million euros (net profits of 32.3 million euros), while the total amount of long-term loans reached 289.8 million euros. Now, moving on to the loan issue. As is known, in May, July, September, and October of 2023, loans held by Alpha Bank, Piraeus Bank, Eurobank\/(Do Value), and Attica Bank were sold to Fortress Credit Corp.\u2019s special purpose company, \u201cSaturn Financial Investor Designated Activity Company.\u201d Sfakianakis\u2019 management emphasizes that these loans were fully serviced. More recently, in March 2024, the loan from the National Bank was also transferred to the same Fortress company. Thus, the acquisition of 100% of the Bonds held by domestic banks in Sfakianakis S.A., as well as Alpha Bank\u2019s bonds in its subsidiaries Ergotrak, Speedex, and Mirkat OOD, was completed. Based on this development, Sfakianakis\u2019 management was in advanced discussions with Fortress to restructure the loans \u201ctaking into account the new conditions of increased financial costs and, most importantly, the prospects of the sectors in which the Group\u2019s subsidiaries operate.\u201d Thus, on August 1, 2024, an agreement was signed to modify the bond loan of Sfakianakis S.A. under favorable terms, along with extension contracts for other loans, which, according to the management, \u201cin combination with the increase in sales and profitability of the Group, lays the foundations for the realization of significant strategic goals set for the coming years.\u201d The modification signed on August 1, 2024, includes a fixed interest rate payment and stipulates that most of the accrued interest \u201cis part of the principal to be repaid in September 2026 and thus does not constitute a short-term obligation.\u201d The exports cost Steel Industry of Greece Last year, the Steel Industry of Greece saw a 20% decrease in its sales, primarily due to the drop in exports, according to the management of the group, which is one of the largest steel product manufacturing industries in the Balkans. The Steel Industry of Greece, owned by the Manesis family, recorded sales of \u20ac265 million last year, compared to \u20ac333 million in the previous year, based on the balance sheet posted. However, operating profitability remained at satisfactory levels, as the decrease in exports due to the international economic environment was largely offset by the improved performance of the domestic construction market, where the company participates as a key supplier (both in infrastructure projects within public investments and in private projects). In terms of profit before tax, the result was positive (\u20ac45 million), but it decreased by 42% compared to 2022. The key point for the industrial group is that it successfully completed the restructuring agreement, which was ratified in the summer of 2022, and now, as the management states, it will focus on further improving the productivity of its factories and securing competitive energy costs. It is worth noting that, under the restructuring agreement, the Steel Industry of Greece reduced its debt by exchanging part of its loans for its facilities in Aspropyrgos, Attica. The Germans support the app Freenow Hellas Freenow Hellas, the company managing the popular taxi app with over 9,000 registered drivers and 1.5 million registered users, continues to receive support from its parent company, Intelligent Apps GmbH from Hamburg. In fact, the company, considering it had a negative net position, as reflected in the financial results at the end of 2023, requested and received assurance from the sole shareholder that \u201cit intends to provide financial support to the company to the extent deemed necessary.\u201d In 2023, the subsidiary of the international Freenow group again reported losses, though reduced compared to the immediately previous year. Specifically, its turnover for 2023 was \u20ac11.1 million, up from \u20ac9 million in 2022, while the after-tax results were negative, with losses of \u20ac2.47 million, down from losses of \u20ac4.48 million in 2022. The reduction in losses is mainly attributed to the increase in gross revenues as a result of the first full year of operations on the FREENOW platform, as well as the containment of expenses, especially for marketing, which had been particularly high during the previous closed year when the company transitioned from the BEAT platform to the FREENOW platform. For the current year, the company\u2019s progress is considered, according to management, \u201csatisfactory. Completing a longer period since the transition to the FREENOW platform and a total of 12 years since BEAT was established in the Greek market, FREENOW maintains its position as the No.1 Taxi App in Greece,\u201d states the management about the app, which operates in 9 countries and 150 cities, and has also expanded into new areas, including for the first time in Crete. Investments in 11 Student Dormitories Yesterday, the Government Committee for National Strategic Projects met and discussed student housing. The idea is that if students have options for accommodation in student dormitories, it will free up homes to cover some of the housing needs of families. The Government Committee decided to immediately upgrade the student dormitories owned by the state and managed by the Ministry of Education through \u0399.\u039d\u0395.\u0394\u0399.\u0392\u0399.\u039c (Institute of Youth and Lifelong Learning). A plan for renovation and energy upgrading was drawn up, while \u0399.\u039d\u0395.\u0394\u0399.\u0392\u0399.\u039c has completed the study for the renovation of the emblematic building of the Athens Student Dormitory. It was also decided to involve the Strategic Contracts Unit (PPF) of the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund (TAIPED), which was tasked with \u201cmaturing\u201d the overall action for 11 dormitories and the tender specifically for the Athens Student Dormitory. London\u2019s calling With the help of Canada and the DBRS rating agency (which is considered highly reliable by the European Central Bank), promises for dividend distributions twice the value of this year\u2019s (from \u20ac800 million to \u20ac1.5 billion), and with clear and optimistic financial statements published \u2013 finally, with the help of the successful Bloomberg event broadcasted across all its networks \u2013 the managements of the systemic banks are traveling to London today. The JP Morgan roadshow in London today is the first major event after the U.S. elections amidst geopolitical developments. Yesterday, the stock market bid them farewell with significant purchases in the 4 stocks of the systemic banks, without serious resistance from sellers. Instinctive reaction with low volume The major drop in the General Index two days ago occurred with a trading value exceeding \u20ac152 million. Yesterday\u2019s healthy reaction, following five consecutive negative sessions, pushed the General Index above the technically important level of 1,380 units, but with a trading value that barely exceeded \u20ac100 million (with \u20ac10 million in block trades). Among the good news of the day, it should be mentioned that most of the transactions did not involve banking stocks, as 60% of the turnover was in non-banking stocks. From early morning, TITAN supported the market with an impressive rise of over +6% and ultimately closed with impressive gains of +4.41% at \u20ac35.5. Everything indicates that the public offering of TITAN America is approaching, with a planned timeline in early 2025. Cenergy (+3.31%) at \u20ac8.42 took its revenge after violent fluctuations yesterday, OTE (+2.19%) approached \u20ac15, Metlen (+1.76%) rebounded to \u20ac31.28, OPAP (+1.2%) announced results and regained \u20ac15, while Lamda at \u20ac7.08 (+1.72%) and Sarantis (+1.93%) provided the necessary support. Bitcoin offers big profits without underlying value The newly elected President Trump decided to replace the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler (a professor at MIT), selecting in his place a lawyer who became famous in America defending the legalization and spread of cryptocurrencies, Teresa Goody Guillen. Following this news, Bitcoin reached another all-time high, surpassing $94,000 on Wednesday, and now forecasts are being made for $100,000 and $120,000. There are many predictions. The fact is that from now on, the U.S. government will be clearly pro-cryptocurrency, which sustains investor confidence in this opaque market. Secondly, traditional currencies, even the dollar, are suffering from inflationary pressures, which has led both institutional and private investors toward alternative assets, such as cryptocurrencies. The broader adoption of blockchain technology across all sectors strengthens Bitcoin\u2019s position as market leader. Furthermore, there is a global trend where investors avoid traditional markets and seek refuge in decentralized, non-state assets. Once again, the Japanese yen takes center stage The U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) promises it is headed for another interest rate cut on the dollar. However, no one seems to believe it, as the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d policy requires a strong dollar with high interest rates. One of the first victims of the dollar is the Japanese yen, whose exchange rate reached 155 yen per $1, the lowest level since last July. The yen has depreciated by -11% over the last two months and is now trading at levels where Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance intervened in the markets earlier this year. Japan spent $62 billion to support its currency at the end of April and early May. Last July, the yen hit its lowest level in the past 38 years, and the Bank of Japan spent another $36 billion to support its currency.

Her bold style choices paid off and, despite being one of the only freshers in a sea of senior students at the auditions, Galvo landed the highly sought-after lead role of Velma Kelly. Performance is in Galvo\u2019s blood, with her love of storytelling going back to her early schooldays. \u201cI used to do a one-woman cabaret in the corner of the yard at lunch. People [would] gather around and listen to stories I would tell,\u201d she recalls. On meeting the rising star, it\u2019s easy to understand why. Galvo has been blessed with the gift of the gab. From South Dublin, Galvo made her West End debut in September \u2013 not in theatre, but in comedy. After studying global business at TCD, she followed her passion for performing and pursued a masters at Mountview, one of London\u2019s leading drama schools. Galvo\u2019s self-proclaimed \u201cposh all-girls school upbringing\u201d is the butt of most of her jokes. Her satirical posts on TikTok, coupled with relatable, honest content about topics such as mental health, body image and dating, have resonated with a large, mostly female audience. Refreshingly candid and self-aware, Galvo takes her privilege and pokes fun at it with her show The Shite Feminist, which was written while she was still at college. Her show opens with an anecdote about developing the successful stand-up piece. In drama school, everyone was encouraged to choose a topic dear to their hearts to inspire their final show. \u201cPeople wrote about race and sexuality, growing up in poverty, all these hardships essentially that they have been through and are passionate about,\u201d Galvo says. \u201cAnyone can tell I have not been through many hardships, I\u2019m a very privileged person.\u201d And so The Shite Feminist was born. \u201cI think I wanted to highlight the fact that I was very privileged,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy for me and other girls in my position to be like \u2018We don\u2019t need feminism. I\u2019m working in JP Morgan and I have a college degree\u2019 but I\u2019m like, \u2018it\u2019s not all about you\u2019. I\u2019m a straight, white, middle-class woman, the only part there that is some sort of a disadvantage is that I\u2019m a woman and not a straight white man.\u201d Entering what has traditionally been a male-dominated space hasn\u2019t always been straightforward. Even now, the reaction to a female comic can be mixed. At Galvo\u2019s show in Leicester Square Theatre, a milestone event for the comedian, she saw it first-hand. \u201cThese four finance guys who I had met at my work friend\u2019s event in London came along,\u201d she says. \u201cTwenty minutes before the end, one of them turned to his friend in the front row and was like \u2018she\u2019s actually kind of funny\u2019. I called him out and we had a bit. But it\u2019s like, what do you mean \u2018she\u2019s actually kind of funny\u2019. I\u2019ve sold over 5,000 tickets to comedy shows, what do you mean?\u201d Galvo has found herself subjected to some online trolls since growing a large following on TikTok. While most of the comments are water off a duck\u2019s back, she has witnessed a more sinister side to the platform. \u201cThere is this ... culture of incels,\u201d she says. \u201cMen who not only hate to see women in equal positions in the workplace, but who find it even scarier when there\u2019s a woman on stage with a microphone and there\u2019s no one to talk over her or cut her off.\u201d For Galvo, it\u2019s important not to sanitise her comedy for the comfort of those kinds of people. The historical tendency of women to lean towards self-deprecating humour was one subject Galvo delved into when writing her thesis. It\u2019s something she still thinks about today as a performer. \u201cThe only way women would be funny was if they made fun of themselves, which is reinforcing the stereotype of us being below men on the hierarchy. I was just really passionate not to do that,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the beginning, when I did my first few shows, I was really scared to talk about the uncomfortable topics. I used to brush over them and be like, \u2018Oh but not all men!\u2019 and all this kind of stuff. But then I was like, \u2018you know what, f**k that. I just have to own the space\u2019. If I try to be more palatable then I\u2019m not doing what I set out to do.\u201d She recommends everyone read Roxane Gay\u2019s book Bad Feminist and They Used to Call Me Snow White by Gina Barreca, both of which she credits for inspiring The Shite Feminist. Asked if she could invite any six people to a dinner party, dead or alive, Galvo draws on her biggest inspirations, settling on Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Sharon Horgan, Sally Rooney, Florence Welch, either Stephen Sondheim or Andrew Lloyd Webber (she can\u2019t choose), and of course her mother. Strong presences all, and directional ones for Galvo in her career. \u201cGoing through each stage of my life, I started realising the times when we were treated differently because we were women,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had a virgin society in our school and there was no virgin society in the boy\u2019s schools.\u201d From the most formative ages, she believes, a certain sense of shame and an instinct to make oneself smaller is instilled in young girls, something she reflects on in her stage shows. I think there\u2019s an assumption, at least among the people I grew up with, that you\u2019re a performer because you can\u2019t do anything else \u201cI wouldn\u2019t send my girls to an all-girls school when I have kids,\u201d she says. \u201cI think being a teenager is really hard but I think that is exacerbated in an all-girls posh school where money comes into it,\u201d she says. Aside from the usual trials and tribulations of girlhood, Galvo found she struggled in school, only recently coming to understand why: \u201cI have very bad ADHD,\u201d she says. Galvo\u2019s diagnosis last year helped her to make sense of herself. \u201cI think people will probably roll their eyes and say that\u2019s because TikTok is telling everyone they have everything. But I always knew there was something wrong with my attention. \u201cThe lack of stimulation in school and sitting in a classroom for six hours a day, my brain used to go wild ... My brain is always going to work at 1,000 miles per hour, it\u2019s just whether it\u2019s focused on something good or something bad.\u201d Again, gender comes into it. \u201cADHD was a boy\u2019s disease ... I was diagnosed with very bad anxiety at the age of 18 and I was like okay that feels right. But then it just continued through college and I started to recognise patterns in myself of when I\u2019m really busy, I\u2019m thriving.\u201d As well as posting her regular \u201cSouth Dublin girlo\u201d skits online, Galvo uses her platform on social media to speak openly about her mental health struggles. In one TikTok video she breaks down the stigma of taking anti-anxiety medication as a form of self-regulation, something Galvo has been doing for years. \u201cPeople underestimate the power of mental health medication,\u201d she says. [\u00a0The funny thing about Irish comedy: Why it doesn\u2019t hurt to be rich if you want to be a stand-upOpens in new window\u00a0] There were other barriers too. Despite spending the most treasured part of her education on stage (\u201cI honestly feel that shows are how I measured my life, rather than school years\u201d, she says), Galvo\u2019s path to a career in entertainment has been far from straightforward. More than once, she describes caving in under the pressure to fit the mould expected from her growing up. \u201cI think there\u2019s an assumption, at least among the people I grew up with, that you\u2019re a performer because you can\u2019t do anything else or because you\u2019re not smart or intelligent. I resented that and wanted to show people I could still be intelligent and booksmart, even though I didn\u2019t really enjoy it,\u201d she says. After completing a whirlwind scholarship programme at a Boston Broadway prep school in summer 2016, Galvo had got a taste for the big life. Studying for the Leaving Certificate was quite the comedown. With the full support of her family, Galvo started auditioning for stage schools, but when it eventually came to crunch time she let fear get the better of her, opting to study business instead of following her heart. \u201cIn Christmas of sixth year, my mum said it was like I woke up one day and had a complete change of heart,\u201d she says. \u201cI think I was really scared of being judged. Dublin, even South Dublin, is such a concentrated bubble and everyone knows everyone. And I was just terrified at the thought of anyone laughing at me.\u201d These days, they are laughing, but for all the right reasons. Having recently brought The Shite Feminist show to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, London\u2019s Leicester Square Theatre and to several sold out dates in Dublin, it seems that Galvo\u2019s comedy career is on the cusp of skyrocketing. And Galvo has learned to harness her particular way of being to add fuel to future creative projects. \u201cOn my computer there\u2019s always at least four Word docs open,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I\u2019m in a creative mindset, I\u2019ll have four different thought processes happening at the same time and that\u2019s when I\u2019m thinking best.\u201d With a new comedy show in the works, Galvo\u2019s career direction seems assured \u2013 and she hopes more women will follow in her path.

AI enhances governance, risk, a","url":"https:\/\/www.finextra.com\/blogposting\/27235\/governance-risk-and-compliance-how-ai-will-make-fintech-comply","published_at":"2024-11-19T16:00:52Z","content":"Community AI enhances governance, risk, and compliance by automating processes, improving fraud detection, and supporting regulatory frameworks focused on transparency and accountability. \u00a0 Artificial Intelligence (AI)\u00a0is reshaping\u00a0Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)\u00a0in financial services, offering unprecedented opportunities to streamline operations, enhance risk management, and meet complex regulatory demands. However, its transformative\r\n potential remains untapped for many fintech firms due to fragmented regulations, ethical concerns, and technical barriers. To stay competitive and compliant in a rapidly evolving industry, fintech companies must strategically integrate AI-driven solutions\r\n while navigating the global regulatory landscape and addressing operational challenges. Policy Automation AI excels in\u00a0policy management automation\u00a0by analyzing large volumes of regulatory updates and mapping them to existing frameworks. Machine learning algorithms detect discrepancies and suggest modifications to ensure continuous compliance.\r\n For instance, JPMorgan Chase utilizes AI to monitor regulatory changes across 120,000 websites, drastically reducing manual reviews and compliance lag\u200b. Real-Time Monitoring Real-time monitoring systems powered by AI can scrutinize millions of transactions, instantly flagging anomalies such as unusual account activity or breaches of compliance protocols. These tools leverage natural language processing (NLP) and advanced analytics\r\n to uncover hidden risks. For example, AI-driven platforms used in banks monitor international wire transfers to detect patterns indicative of money laundering, ensuring governance integrity. AI-driven\u00a0predictive analytics\u00a0forecasts potential risks using historical and real-time data. By identifying emerging threats like credit defaults or market downturns, AI helps financial institutions proactively manage risks. Wells Fargo,\r\n for example, uses AI models to predict shifts in credit risk, enabling faster, data-driven decisions while minimizing exposure to bad loans\u200b. AI systems are particularly effective in\u00a0fraud detection, processing vast amounts of transactional data to spot fraudulent activities. By employing deep learning and anomaly detection algorithms, AI can identify fraud schemes such as phishing,\r\n unauthorized account access, or synthetic identity fraud. AI tools have reduced false positives by 50% and improved detection rates by 30%, as seen in JPMorgan Chase\u2019s fraud detection initiatives\u200b. Enhanced Climate and Cyber Risk Assessment Financial institutions are integrating AI into climate risk models, using it to evaluate sustainability metrics and predict environmental impacts. Additionally, AI-powered tools help identify cyber threats by scanning network activity for anomalies, bolstering\r\n overall risk management strategies\u200b. Regulatory Surveillance AI enables\u00a0regulatory surveillance\u00a0by parsing complex legal texts and monitoring regulatory updates in real-time. Generative AI models, trained on large datasets, can answer compliance-related queries and compare institutional policies against\r\n changing regulations. This allows institutions to swiftly adapt to new requirements, reducing risks of non-compliance and penalties\u200b. Compliance reporting is another area where AI delivers significant value. By automating the collection, aggregation, and analysis of compliance data, AI reduces the time and resources required for regulatory reporting. AI systems can generate accurate, standardized\r\n reports in seconds, ensuring timeliness and accuracy in submissions to regulators. AI\u2019s automation capabilities drastically reduce time spent on manual tasks such as regulatory tracking, policy updates, and risk assessments. For example, regulatory compliance tools using AI algorithms can process regulatory changes at a fraction of the\r\n time compared to human teams, significantly increasing efficiency. AI minimizes financial losses related to fraud and operational inefficiencies. It also helps avoid regulatory fines through improved compliance. According to a Juniper Research report, AI-driven compliance solutions are expected to save the financial industry\r\n over $1.2 billion annually by 2025. AI provides data-driven insights that empower better decision-making in areas like credit underwriting, investment strategies, and operational adjustments. By delivering accurate risk forecasts and compliance trends, institutions are better equipped to meet\r\n strategic objectives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds immense promise for transforming governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) functions in the financial sector. However, its adoption has been disappointingly slow. While 75% of financial institutions are exploring AI solutions,\r\n only 37% have moved beyond experimentation to actively implement AI tools for compliance and risk management. This disparity reflects significant hurdles in scaling AI applications, leaving many institutions unable to fully leverage the technology's potential. One of the primary reasons for this slow adoption is the complex and fragmented regulatory landscape surrounding AI. Financial institutions operate in a heavily regulated environment where transparency, accountability, and fairness are non-negotiable. The\r\n absence of unified global regulations creates uncertainty, forcing firms to navigate overlapping or contradictory rules in different jurisdictions. This lack of clarity delays decision-making and implementation. Data privacy and security regulations, such as GDPR, impose strict requirements on how sensitive customer data is collected, stored, and used by AI systems. Many financial institutions struggle to reconcile these requirements with AI's reliance on large\r\n datasets. Additionally, concerns about bias and fairness have prompted regulators to demand rigorous audits and explainability of AI models, further increasing the compliance burden. While AI can enhance GRC functions significantly, regulatory challenges\u2014combined with organizational and technological barriers\u2014remain a critical obstacle to its widespread adoption in the financial sector. Regulatory authorities worldwide have identified several key areas of focus to ensure the responsible and secure integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in financial services. These priorities address the ethical, operational, and security challenges\r\n posed by AI, aiming to establish robust frameworks for governance, risk, and compliance (GRC). One of the foremost regulatory challenges for AI is ensuring\u00a0transparency\u00a0and\u00a0explainability\u00a0in its decision-making processes. Unlike traditional software systems, many AI models\u2014especially those utilizing machine learning\r\n (ML) and deep learning\u2014operate as \"black boxes,\" making their outputs difficult to interpret. Regulatory Mandates: Technical Solutions: Example in Financial Services: In credit scoring, AI systems must explain why an applicant was approved or denied. This clarity ensures compliance with anti-discrimination laws and helps build trust with customers. For example, FICO has\r\n adopted explainable AI techniques in its credit scoring algorithms to provide stakeholders with actionable insights. AI systems in financial services rely on vast amounts of sensitive data, including transactional records, personal details, and market analytics. As such,\u00a0data privacy and security\u00a0are paramount. Regulatory Requirements: Technical Solutions: Example in Financial Services: AI-based fraud detection systems analyze transactional data to identify suspicious activities. To comply with data privacy regulations, banks use PETs to anonymize sensitive information while ensuring the AI\r\n system remains effective. AI systems can unintentionally perpetuate or amplify biases present in training data, leading to unfair outcomes. In financial services, this risk is particularly acute in areas like loan approvals, insurance underwriting, and fraud detection. Regulatory Requirements: Technical Solutions: Example in Financial Services: Wells Fargo revamped its credit scoring AI system after identifying racial biases that disadvantaged certain demographics. By incorporating diverse datasets and fairness audits, the bank reduced discriminatory\r\n patterns by 25%. Clear lines of accountability are essential for AI-driven decisions, especially in financial services, where errors or misconduct can have severe repercussions. Regulatory Guidelines: Technical Solutions: Example in Financial Services: A global bank faced scrutiny when its AI-based trading algorithm caused significant losses. Following the incident, the institution adopted HITL systems to ensure human oversight of high-value trades, meeting\r\n regulatory demands for accountability. AI systems evolve over time as they interact with new data, making\u00a0continuous monitoring and auditing\u00a0critical to maintaining integrity and compliance. Regulatory Requirements: Technical Solutions: Example in Financial Services: AI-driven anti-money laundering (AML) systems continuously monitor transactions. Banks like HSBC implement real-time auditing tools to ensure these systems adapt to evolving regulatory requirements without\r\n compromising performance. Ethics and governance are foundational to AI regulation, ensuring systems align with societal values and organizational goals. Regulatory Requirements: Technical Solutions: Example in Financial Services: JP Morgan Chase introduced an AI ethics committee to oversee its deployment of machine learning models in areas like lending and investment management, ensuring ethical considerations are central to its operations. The integration of\u00a0Artificial Intelligence (AI)\u00a0in financial services has the potential to revolutionize\u00a0governance, risk, and compliance (GRC)\u00a0processes. However, this transformative technology brings challenges that demand\r\n robust and region-specific regulatory measures to ensure ethical implementation, operational efficiency, and security. Here is a closer look at how global regulatory authorities are addressing these challenges, with technical details and real-world examples. The EU has taken a proactive stance with its proposed\u00a0Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act), aiming to establish one of the world's most comprehensive AI regulatory frameworks. The legislation emphasizes a\u00a0risk-based classification\u00a0system\r\n that categorizes AI applications into four tiers: minimal risk, limited risk, high risk, and unacceptable risk. The EU AI Act has prompted fintech firms to reassess their credit scoring algorithms. For instance, major European banks now implement bias-detection tools like IBM\u2019s AI Fairness 360 to comply with the Act, ensuring equitable treatment across demographics. The UK adopts a\u00a0flexible and collaborative\u00a0regulatory approach, emphasizing innovation while ensuring ethical AI use. The\u00a0Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)\u00a0leads the charge in shaping AI regulation for financial services,\r\n focusing on balancing regulatory oversight with industry growth. The FCA conducted a \"TechSprint\" focused on detecting fraud using AI, resulting in the development of tools capable of identifying fraudulent transactions with 40% higher accuracy compared to traditional systems. The US lacks a unified federal framework for AI regulation but addresses AI\u2019s implications through\u00a0sector-specific guidelines\u00a0issued by agencies like the\u00a0Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the\u00a0Federal Reserve,\r\n and the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These efforts focus on\u00a0consumer protection,\u00a0market integrity, and\u00a0algorithmic accountability. The SEC recently issued fines to firms employing trading algorithms that lacked safeguards against market manipulation. In response, firms have started implementing real-time AI audit tools to monitor and document algorithmic behavior. This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra.

A senior official at the Cyberspace Administration of China told the FT that foreign device makers would find a \"simple and straightforward approval process\" if they utilize already-approved large language models (LLMs) from Chinese companies, rather than attempting to implement their own AI systems. The regulatory situation has reportedly prompted Apple to engage in discussions with several Chinese tech companies, including search giant Baidu, ByteDance, and AI startup Moonshot, to potentially power Apple Intelligence features in devices sold in mainland China. Apple CEO Tim Cook arrived in China on Monday to attend a CEO summit with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, in what could be an attempt by Cook to personally navigate the complex regulatory landscape. During his previous visit to Beijing, Cook acknowledged the specific regulatory requirements, stating that Apple was \"working hard\" to bring Apple Intelligence to Chinese consumers. The company has been gradually rolling out Apple Intelligence features in the US and elsewhere since October, with things like Writing Tools and enhanced Siri using a combination of on-device processing and its Private Cloud Compute servers, along with OpenAI's ChatGPT for more complex queries. But if Apple can't secure approval for its own AI models in China, it may need to rely on Chinese partners' LLMs to host AI features on devices sold there. According to JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee, the regulatory uncertainty could delay the launch of Apple Intelligence in China until \"well into the second half of 2025\" or later, unless Apple adopts a flexible approach involving multiple Chinese partnerships to expedite approval. China represents 17% of the company's revenue but saw an 8% decline in sales over the past year. The company faces increasing competition from Huawei, which has already integrated its own AI features into its latest smartphones. Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.

Adams knew it was time to leave \"Suits\" after a conversation with his mom. On Tuesday's episode of \"Dinner's on Me with Jesse Tyler Ferguson,\" the Canadian-American actor said his character's storyline on the legal drama had played out by the end of the seventh season. \"It just all had happened, and I was like, where do we go from here?\" said Adams, who played Mike Ross, a Harvard Law School dropout turned unlicensed lawyer. At that point, he knew his costar and on-screen partner, Meghan Markle, was leaving the show. \"And I was like, the only reason to do this was money,\" he said. The \"Plan B\" actor talked to his mom and thought she'd ask him to stay. \"It was like, financially, you have to do this. It's responsible. You've already put in this much time. Just put in two more years,\" he recalled. \"But really, she was the one who was like, 'Is the only reason you're doing this for money?'\" Adams added that he had no issue with anyone on the show. \"It was just like, I've done it. When you reach the end of the thing, there's nothing more. I don't know what else to offer,\" he said. He recalled his mom responding: \"Then you should go. You should be done.\" While Adams left the show after the seventh season in 2018, Gabriel Macht, who plays Harvey Specter, stayed on for the final two seasons. \"Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and think about the money that Gabriel made those last two years,\" Adams said. \"But I never regretted the decision for a second. I knew it was the right thing for my marriage.\" Adams, who married the \"Pretty Little Liars\" star Troian Bellisario in 2016, had been in a long-distance relationship with her for seven years. \"It was time for us to start our lives. We wanted to be together. We wanted to have kids, which we knew would take a couple of years before we were comfortable doing that,\" Adams said. The longer he stayed in Toronto to work on the show, the longer he was \"putting on hold this life that I knew I wanted,\" he said. \"It was time to realize that money is great, but, you know, I'd made enough money that I could go and have my life now.\" First released in 2011, \"Suits\" experienced a resurgence in popularity after being rereleased on streaming platforms such as Netflix. Nielsen, a media audience analytics firm, found that the show topped its list as the most-streamed television series last year, with 57.7 billion minutes streamed on Netflix and Peacock. With its resurgence, the show's creator, Aaron Korsh, is developing a spin-off show called \"Suits L.A.,\" which features Macht. Adams isn't part of its cast. A representative for Adams didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours. In the corporate world, feeling unfulfilled in your job may indicate that it's time to move on. AJ Eckstein told BI that he left his 6-figure consultant job in his dream company after feeling unfulfilled. \"When I started, my self-worth was high, buoyed by the excitement of a new career. As the years passed and my fulfillment waned, my sense of self-worth plummeted, too,\" he said. He eventually decided to leave his job to build a startup. \" Leaving a stable job is risky, but so is staying when you feel unfulfilled,\" he said. Similarly, Ashley Tan left her job as a JP Morgan analyst after feeling like she was wasting her life. \"I found it frustrating to have to stick to the old ways of doing things and I didn't feel fulfilled because I knew I didn't want to pursue marketing long-term,\" she said.

In a note dubbed \u201cBracing for a storm\u201d seen by the outlet, the analysts projected US import taxes on Chinese goods to be raised to 60% from the current 20% mark, with fresh levies to also hit imports from Malaysia and Vietnam. The Chinese government could devalue the yuan in response, and impose retaliatory tariffs to support the national economy, the strategists suggested , forecasting that China\u2019s GDP growth next year coudl slip nearly one point to 3.9%, in spite of the possible measures. JPMorgan highlighted that a potential devaluation of the yuan by 10-15% is \u201csignificantly less than the 28-30% that could be expected if China\u2019s central bank were to rehearse the 2018-19 playbook, when it allowed currency depreciation to offset 70% of the rise in US tariffs.\u201d In 2018, Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 20% from 3%. Earlier this month, the yuan fell to its weakest level against the dollar since late 2023 amid uncertainty over Trump\u2019s victory in the US presidential election. On Thursday, the Chinese currency traded at nearly 7.25 yuan to the greenback. Earlier this week, Trump \u2013 who will take office on January 20 \u2013 pledged to introduce 25% import duties on all products from Canada and Mexico, along with increasing tariffs on Chinese imports to 30%. JPMorgan expects emerging economies, particularly manufacturing exporters such as Malaysia, Vietnam and Mexico, to be the hardest-hit by a US-China trade war. The analysts stressed that the affected states are likely to lose global market share, as Beijing would redirect exports toward other emerging markets.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ) stock traded lower Wednesday after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter financial results and issued fiscal first-quarter adjusted EPS guidance below estimates. On Tuesday, HP reported revenue of $14.05 billion (versus $13.82 billion a year ago), which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $13.99 billion. The EPS of $0.93 was in line with the analyst consensus estimate. Also Read: Apple Faces Modest Growth As IDC Forecasts Smartphone Market Rebound HP expects first-quarter adjusted EPS of $0.70 \u2013 $0.76, versus the $0.85 estimate, and fiscal 2025 adjusted EPS of $3.45 \u2013 $3.75, versus the $3.60 estimate. Multiple Wall Street analysts rerated the stock after the quarterly print. JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee maintained an Overweight rating on HP with a price target of $40, down from $41. Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng reiterated a Neutral rating on HP with a price target of $38, up from $35. JP Morgan: Analyst Chatterjee highlights HP\u2019s near-term challenges and opportunities in the personal systems (PS) and print segments. Despite known headwinds in the PC market, HP faces additional pressure from competitive pricing as it tries to offset higher memory costs. The company remains optimistic about a mid-single-digit recovery in PC units and increased adoption of AI PCs by enterprise customers in fiscal year 2025, supported by pent-up demand and Windows 11 refresh cycles. The print segment performed well, generating $4.5 billion, surpassing expectations, while PS revenue came in at $9.6 billion, slightly below consensus. Operating margins were 8.5%, impacted by higher commodity costs and strategic investments. For fiscal 2025, HP projects full-year revenue growth driven by mid-single-digit increases in PC units and seasonal recovery. However, first-quarter EPS guidance of $0.70 \u2013 $0.76 falls below consensus, reflecting margin pressures and the need for a significant recovery in PC volumes to meet annual targets. HP\u2019s print margins improved to 19.6% in the fourth quarter, exceeding internal and external forecasts. Due to cost discipline, the company anticipates print operating margins will remain at the higher end of the 16% \u2013 19% range in fiscal 2025. Meanwhile, PS margins are expected to climb to the upper half of 5% \u2013 7%, aided by improved pricing strategies and volume leverage. Enterprise PC replacement cycles, supported by Windows 10\u2019s end-of-life in 2025, and increased AI PC adoption are long-term growth drivers. HP\u2019s supply chain resilience positions it to navigate potential tariff escalations better than peers, ensuring smoother operations. Chatterjee maintains an Overweight rating on HP, emphasizing medium-term positioning in PS as a key growth driver. Stabilizing gross margins and operating efficiencies are expected to mitigate some margin pressures. The analyst slightly lowered the December 2025 price target, valuing fiscal 2026 EPS at 10x P\/E, aligning with historical averages. HP\u2019s ability to recover in the PC market and capitalize on enterprise adoption of AI PCs remains critical to achieving long-term targets. While near-term pressures exist, structural improvements in the print and PS segments are expected to provide resilience. Chatterjee projects first-quarter revenue of $13.47 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.75. Goldman Sachs: HP delivered fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 EPS of $0.93, aligning with Goldman Sachs (GS) and consensus estimates. Print segment performance offset a modest miss in the Personal Systems (PS) division. Print revenue grew for the first time since fiscal fourth-quarter 2021, increasing 1% to $4.5 billion, surpassing GS and consensus projections of $4.3 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. This growth stemmed from solid supplies and industrial graphics sales, although pricing pressures persisted. Print margins reached 19.6%, exceeding guidance and analyst expectations ((GS: 18.5%, XHKG:18), reflecting a favorable business mix and cost efficiencies. HP expects Print revenue to decline to low single digits (LSD%) in fiscal 2025, aligning with broader market trends, while supply revenue is projected to drop LSD to mid-single digits (MSD%). In contrast, PS revenue fell to $9.6 billion, missing GS and consensus estimates of $9.8 billion. While consumer PS revenue declined 4%, commercial PS revenue grew 5%, with unit volumes increasing 4%. HP anticipates mid-single-digit (MSD%) growth in the PS segment for fiscal 2025, driven by factors such as Windows 10 end-of-life, a refreshed PC installed base, and the rise of AI PCs, which are expected to comprise 20% of shipments. HP anticipates more robust performance in the second half of fiscal 2025 as PC demand accelerates, supported by the commercial segment, premium consumer systems, and AI PCs. Commodity cost pressures impacting PS margins are expected to subside in the latter half of the fiscal year, aided by cost reductions and pricing strategies. Ng remains neutral on HP, raising the 12-month price target based on a 10x P\/E multiple. The revised valuation reflects HP\u2019s market share gains in commercial and premium PC segments.

Investors, investment bankers, and private equity have viewed the change in Washington as heralding a possible improvement in both mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity as well as public equity issuance. The Biden Administration, led by Gary Gensler, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Lina Khan, the commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, has restricted both public offerings due to a higher regulatory burden as well as legally challenging an increased number of mergers and acquisitions. These two factors have chilled the deal environment over the last several years as shown below on the charts from Bloomberg. Figure 1-2: M&A Deals Globally and in the U.S., Trailing 10 Years     In terms of initial public offerings (IPOs) in the U.S., the numbers are back on the rise after two slow years, although still well off the 2021 peak. This is important for investors as the number of public companies in the U.S. has fallen from a peak of 8,090 in 1996 to roughly 4,300 today. This has been offset by a spectacular rise in the number of owned or backed private equity (PE) companies. According to JP Morgan, PE sponsored firms have grown from 1,900 to 11,200 over the last 20 years. William O\u2019Neil + Co. suspects that there is some level of pent-up demand both from investors for new offerings as well as companies waiting to go public. After a spike in 2021, the last three years have continued the trend of the last decade in terms of a low number of total IPOs versus history as seen on the two charts below. Figures 3-4: U.S. IPOs and SPACs, Trailing 10 Years     Interestingly, Health Care has had the highest number of IPOs year-to-date followed by Capital Equipment and then Technology. Technology IPOs have been particularly weak as many companies have either raised money from venture capital, private equity or been acquired. If the IPO market reaccelerates over the next four years, we would expect a spike in Technology offerings led by the AI area. Figure 5-6: IPOs by Sector and Technology IPO $ Amount     Remarkably, IPO related ETFs have had good price performance recently and we believe are signaling a better deal environment. Below are six Datagraphs\u00ae of IPO related ETFs. All have a positive slope and are trading above their 50- and 200-day moving averages. Figure 7a and 7b: Daily\/Weekly Mini Charts of IPO-Related ETFs     A forecasted pick up in IPOs and secondaries would also likely coincide with an improvement in the relative performance of small capitalization companies. Small cap companies have greatly underperformed their large cap brethren over the last four years. The recent improvement in small cap price performance may create an opportunity for companies to raise money. Also, a stronger U.S. economy combined with a better deal cycle could lead to small cap outperformance. Figures 8 and 9 show that both primary and secondary equity offerings are up versus the past two years, but still less than half of the 2020\/2021 annual total. Figures 8-9: Number and Dollar Amount of U.S. Equity Offerings, Trailing 10 Years     Finally, a major beneficiary of an improved M&A and equity offering cycle would be the U.S. investment banks. Many of these stocks have emerged in the second half of the year to be market leaders. Below is the weekly Datagraph of the investment bank O\u2019Neil Industry Group, which is enjoying a strong period of price leadership. While extended in the short term, investment banks are clearly a leading group and a profitable area for finding individual stocks. Some stocks to consider with high Relative Strength ideas include Jefferies Financial Group (JEF), PJT Partners (PJT), Raymond James Financial (RJF), Lazard (LAZ), Piper Sandler Companies (PIPR), Evercore (EVR), Houlihan Lokey (HLI), and Perella Weinberg Partners (PWP). We would encourage investors to do more research on these names for possible inclusion in the portfolios.

Analysts maintain ratings, but revise price targets.","url":"https:\/\/www.benzinga.com\/24\/11\/42221416\/hp-faces-margin-pressure-but-analysts-see-ai-pcs-driving-growth-in-2025","published_at":"2024-11-27T20:34:27Z","content":"HP Inc HPQ stock traded lower Wednesday after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter financial results and issued fiscal first-quarter adjusted EPS guidance below estimates. On Tuesday, HP reported revenue of $14.05 billion (versus $13.82 billion a year ago), which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $13.99 billion. The EPS of $0.93 was in line with the analyst consensus estimate. Also Read: Apple Faces Modest Growth As IDC Forecasts Smartphone Market Rebound HP expects first-quarter adjusted EPS of $0.70 \u2013 $0.76, versus the $0.85 estimate, and fiscal 2025 adjusted EPS of $3.45 \u2013 $3.75, versus the $3.60 estimate. Multiple Wall Street analysts rerated the stock after the quarterly print. JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee maintained an Overweight rating on HP with a price target of $40, down from $41. Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng reiterated a Neutral rating on HP with a price target of $38, up from $35. JP Morgan: Analyst Chatterjee highlights HP\u2019s near-term challenges and opportunities in the personal systems (PS) and print segments. Despite known headwinds in the PC market, HP faces additional pressure from competitive pricing as it tries to offset higher memory costs. The company remains optimistic about a mid-single-digit recovery in PC units and increased adoption of AI PCs by enterprise customers in fiscal year 2025, supported by pent-up demand and Windows 11 refresh cycles. The print segment performed well, generating $4.5 billion, surpassing expectations, while PS revenue came in at $9.6 billion, slightly below consensus. Operating margins were 8.5%, impacted by higher commodity costs and strategic investments. For fiscal 2025, HP projects full-year revenue growth driven by mid-single-digit increases in PC units and seasonal recovery. However, first-quarter EPS guidance of $0.70 \u2013 $0.76 falls below consensus, reflecting margin pressures and the need for a significant recovery in PC volumes to meet annual targets. HP\u2019s print margins improved to 19.6% in the fourth quarter, exceeding internal and external forecasts. Due to cost discipline, the company anticipates print operating margins will remain at the higher end of the 16% \u2013 19% range in fiscal 2025. Meanwhile, PS margins are expected to climb to the upper half of 5% \u2013 7%, aided by improved pricing strategies and volume leverage. Enterprise PC replacement cycles, supported by Windows 10\u2019s end-of-life in 2025, and increased AI PC adoption are long-term growth drivers. HP\u2019s supply chain resilience positions it to navigate potential tariff escalations better than peers, ensuring smoother operations. Chatterjee maintains an Overweight rating on HP, emphasizing medium-term positioning in PS as a key growth driver. Stabilizing gross margins and operating efficiencies are expected to mitigate some margin pressures. The analyst slightly lowered the December 2025 price target, valuing fiscal 2026 EPS at 10x P\/E, aligning with historical averages. HP\u2019s ability to recover in the PC market and capitalize on enterprise adoption of AI PCs remains critical to achieving long-term targets. While near-term pressures exist, structural improvements in the print and PS segments are expected to provide resilience. Chatterjee projects first-quarter revenue of $13.47 billion and adjusted EPS of $0.75. Goldman Sachs: HP delivered fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 EPS of $0.93, aligning with Goldman Sachs (GS) and consensus estimates. Print segment performance offset a modest miss in the Personal Systems (PS) division. Print revenue grew for the first time since fiscal fourth-quarter 2021, increasing 1% to $4.5 billion, surpassing GS and consensus projections of $4.3 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively. This growth stemmed from solid supplies and industrial graphics sales, although pricing pressures persisted. Print margins reached 19.6%, exceeding guidance and analyst expectations ((GS: 18.5%,18, reflecting a favorable business mix and cost efficiencies. HP expects Print revenue to decline to low single digits (LSD%) in fiscal 2025, aligning with broader market trends, while supply revenue is projected to drop LSD to mid-single digits (MSD%). In contrast, PS revenue fell to $9.6 billion, missing GS and consensus estimates of $9.8 billion. While consumer PS revenue declined 4%, commercial PS revenue grew 5%, with unit volumes increasing 4%. HP anticipates mid-single-digit (MSD%) growth in the PS segment for fiscal 2025, driven by factors such as Windows 10 end-of-life, a refreshed PC installed base, and the rise of AI PCs, which are expected to comprise 20% of shipments. HP anticipates more robust performance in the second half of fiscal 2025 as PC demand accelerates, supported by the commercial segment, premium consumer systems, and AI PCs. Commodity cost pressures impacting PS margins are expected to subside in the latter half of the fiscal year, aided by cost reductions and pricing strategies. Ng remains neutral on HP, raising the 12-month price target based on a 10x P\/E multiple. The revised valuation reflects HP\u2019s market share gains in commercial and premium PC segments. Ng projects first-quarter adjusted EPS of $0.75. Price Action: HPQ stock is down 12.5% at $34.22 at last check Wednesday. Also Read: Image via Shutterstock. \u00a9 2024 Benzinga.com.

The service is powered by integrating Mastercard\u2019s multi-token network (MTN) and JP Morgan\u2019s recently rebranded digital payments network, Kinexys (formerly Onyx). In a statement, the Executive Vice President, Blockchain and Digital Assets at Mastercard, Raj Dhamodharan, said, \u201cBy bringing together the power and connectivity of Mastercard\u2019s MTN with Kinexys Digital Payments, we are unlocking greater speed and settlement capabilities for the entire value chain. We are excited about this integration and the new use cases it will bring to life, leveraging the strengths and innovations of both organizations.\u201d A wider push for tokenisation Mastercard\u2019s multi-token network is a blockchain-based network for tokenised bank deposits, stablecoins, and CBDCs. The global payments company piloted the network in June 2023 by inviting UK banks to test tokenised deposits. Meanwhile, JP Morgan\u2019s Kinexys is a payment platform that allows for tokenising real-world assets, facilitates digital payments, and enables cross-border payments. The rise of these networks and platforms from both major financial companies is emblematic of a wider industrial push for blockchain-based financial systems with multi-asset support, fast transaction speeds and settlement times, and strong compliance and AML capabilities. With Mastercard\u2019s MTN, banks can access 24\/7 real-time interbank settlement powered by Mastercard\u2019s private blockchain network. Other market players can also simplify processes like buying carbon credits and unifying financial and compliance standards. The network also settles transactions on public blockchains, private bank payment networks, and legacy settlement infrastructure. Mastercard and JP Morgan are not the only institutions building towards a tokenised on-chain future. Chainlink, a leading blockchain oracle provider, launched CCIP, the cross-chain interoperability protocol in July 2023 to connect private and public blockchains, and invited financial institutions like HSBC and the SWIFT network to participate in successful pilots. Meanwhile, the Kinexys digital payments network has processed more than $1.5 trillion in transactions since its pilot in 2020 and currently processes more than $2 billion in daily transactions.

A high-ranking official from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has warned that foreign companies seeking to launch their own AI models in the country will face a \u201cdifficult and long process\u201d for approval. The CAC official says that partnering with local Chinese AI companies would lead to a \u201csimple and straightforward approval process\u201d for foreign device makers. This stance puts Apple in a challenging position. Apple has been looking for the use of its own large language models (LLMs) in China. However, the company has also reportedly in discussions with Chinese tech giants such as Baidu, ByteDance, and Moonshot AI. That\u2019s why we posted earlier this year about Apple\u2019s AI approach in China; it should swallow pride and copy Samsung. Apple CEO Tim Cook has made multiple visits to China in recent months, including a trip on November 27, 2024, to attend a CEO summit with Chinese Premier Li Qiang. The regulatory environment in China could significantly delay the launch of Apple Intelligence in the country. JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee suggests that without a flexible approach involving multiple Chinese partnerships, the launch might be postponed until \u201cwell into the second half of 2025\u201d or later.

Attruby was designed to mimic a naturally occurring \u201crescue mutation\u201d of the TTR gene (T119M) that targets the root cause of ATTR-CM, the destabilization of the native TTR tetramer. Through near-complete TTR stabilization, Attruby has been shown to preserve the native function of TTR as a transport protein of thyroxine and vitamin A and to demonstrate benefit on cardiovascular outcomes. The ATTRibute-CM Phase 3 study enrolled 632 participants with symptomatic ATTR-CM associated with either wild-type or variant TTR. BridgeBio submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency, with a decision expected in 2025. BridgeBio has granted\u00a0Bayer AG (OTC:BAYRY)\u00a0exclusive rights to commercialize acoramidis for ATTR-CM in Europe.

Reliance stock is down 22 per cent from its peak on July 8 (NIFTY down 3.3 per cent), sharply reversing outperformance from earlier in the year. In a market where most stocks are trading well above historical valuations, Reliance's fair relative valuations are an attraction. The company helmed by billionaire Mukesh Ambani has three main business verticals - oil refining and petrochemical business housed in oil-to-chemical (O2C) unit, telecom arm Jio and retail. It also has a media unit and a new energy business. Reliance Retail plus Telecom now account for about 50 per cent of total 2023-24 (FY24) consolidated EBITDA. These, JP Morgan estimates, will account for almost all of net EBITDA growth over the next three years. With an EBITDA run-rate of USD 20 billion a year, Reliance is expected to deliver positive free cash flow for the next three years (despite elevated capex plans at new energy complex and in the retail business, and towards petchem capacity expansions).  \"We see two headwinds hurting: 1) refining margins fell sharply starting June, and 2) revenue \/ EBITDA growth at its consumer retail subsidiary (Reliance Retail) continued to disappoint,\" it said. According to JP Morgan, refining margins have rebounded recently, improving third-quarter run rates. The reduction of Chinese export tax rebates could help support cracks (the difference between raw material crude oil and finished product prices). \"Is retail growth bottoming as well? This is difficult to anticipate near term as Reliance Retail has been affected by a general retail slowdown and specific company restructuring. Investor concerns around the impact of Quick Commerce remain,\" it said. Reliance retail implied valuations are low. JP Morgan said some of the initial solar (module \/ cell) capacities that Reliance is working on should be commissioned by March. \"While RIL did not plan to sell output to third parties, and potential profitability is limited, the current strength of local demand might force a rethink. Reliance stock might benefit from an announcement of commissioning given high valuations of recently listed solar companies in India,\" it said. According to the brokerage, the anticipated listing of Jio \/ Retail could take time due to the recent market weakness and potential large size of these issuances.  \"We review our retail forecasts, cutting FY25-26 EBITDA 10-15 per cent. As retail is a small portion of total earnings, RIL consolidated (post minority) PAT forecasts change only 4-6 per cent,\" it added.  \n\t\tComments\n\t\t BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

REUTERS\/Dado Ruvic\/Illustration\/ FIle Photo     Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike raised its annual revenue and profit forecasts and beat third-quarter revenue on Tuesday, betting on growing demand for cybersecurity services amid growing online threats. Businesses are increasingly investing in Crowdstrike's comprehensive cybersecurity services to combat the widespread threat of online hacking and digital fraud. Several companies, including AT&T, Live Nation Entertainment's Ticketmaster unit and UnitedHealth Group have been targeted by online hacking attempts this year. Shares of Crowdstrike were down about 2 per cent in extended trading after its fourth-quarter revenue forecast failed to impress investors. \"Despite expected headwinds from the July 19th incident. We saw incredible success with our customer commitment packages as customers embraced the program and chose to deepen their relationship with CrowdStrike,\" CFO Burt Podbere said. CrowdStrike expects its annual revenue to be between $3.92 billion and $3.93 billion, compared with its prior expectations of $3.89 billion to $3.90 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $3.90 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. JP Morgan analysts said in a note ahead of the results that they expect \"reaccelaration\" of growth and profitability, despite the near-term pressure from the outage. Similarly, rival Palo Alto Networks beat estimates for its first quarter, benefiting from robust spending in November.  CrowdStrike now expects its annual adjusted profit per share to be between $3.74 and $3.76, up from its previous estimate range of $3.61 to $3.65.    The company's revenue for the third quarter, ended Oct.31, rose about 29 per cent to $1.01 billion, beating estimates of $982.4 million.    CrowdStrike expects fourth-quarter revenue to be between $1.03 billion and $1.04 billion, compared to analysts' estimates of $1.03 billion.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. By Naomi Rovnick and Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON (Reuters) -As the euro heads for its worst month since early 2022, analysts warn that a wild ride in the currency could be the next source of global market volatility after gyrations in Japan's yen sparked a bout of cross-asset turmoil in August. Europe's single currency has slumped by just over 3% against the dollar in November. It is now teetering towards the key $1 mark, pressured by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade tariffs, euro zone economic weakness and an escalating Russia\/Ukraine conflict, just as U.S. growth bets lift U.S. stocks and the dollar. France's political woes are another potential headwind, with French consumer confidence at a five-month low and the fate of the new government and its budget at risk. Investors and currency traders, however, are divided about what comes next because the dollar is also vulnerable to inflationary tariffs and government debt increases shaking faith in U.S. markets and the economy. This uncertainty could increase if the euro drops further, raising the threat level for unexpected currency shifts that could upend highly popular so-called Trump trades, which bank on the euro falling as U.S. stocks rise, analysts said. \"We'll get volatility because people will start to think: Are we breaking through (euro-dollar) parity or will it snap back?\" Societe Generale head of FX strategy Kit Juckes said. \"The minimum we will see is more debate in both directions about the euro and I don't trust these extraordinarily high levels of cross-asset correlations to continue.\" August's market rout began with yen-dollar swings that caught hedge funds betting against the Japanese currency off guard and swelled into stock market selling to fund margin calls. Regulators have warned about market fragility to similar events when popular market narratives rapidly shift, because of high levels of leverage in the system. \"If we crash through (euro-dollar) parity we'll be having those kinds of conversations again,\" Juckes said. SPILLOVERS The euro-dollar is the world's most actively traded currency pair and rapid exchange rate shifts can disrupt multinationals' earnings and the growth and inflation outlook for nations that import commodities and export goods priced in dollars. \"The euro is a benchmark,\" Barclays global head of FX strategy Themos Fiotakis said, meaning trade sensitive nations such as China, South Korea and Switzerland could allow their currencies to weaken against the dollar if the euro dropped further so they can compete with euro zone exports. Britain's pound, down just over 2% against the dollar this month to around $1.26, is highly sensitive to euro moves, he added. Market sensitivity to the euro-dollar rate has also risen after what currency strategists said was a rush by traders into options contracts that combine bets on cross-asset outcomes from Trump's policies, such as the euro weakening and the S&P rising. \"We've seen a lot of people trying to invest in (these) conditional outcomes,\" Fiotakis said, which could raise the correlations between currency moves and wider markets. Investors were underestimating that risk, UBS strategist Alvise Marino said. A gauge of investor demand for protection against near-term euro-dollar swings is trading around 8%, well below a level of almost 14% when the euro last slumped below $1 in October 2022. \"Realised volatility in FX is likely to be high, and certainly higher than markets are pricing in,\" Marino said. He is recommending clients hedge against currency swings via derivatives contracts that pay out if euro volatility is higher a year from now. SPLIT VIEWS Long term asset managers, meanwhile, are deeply divided on where the euro and the dollar go from here, underscoring how this crucial exchange rate could be set for a bumpy ride in coming months. \"We are looking for the euro to go to 99 cents by the middle of the next year,\" said Willem Sels, global chief investment officer at HSBC's private banking and wealth unit. But Vincent Mortier, chief investment officer of Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager, said euro zone rate cuts could boost euro zone business and consumer spending and lift the euro to $1.16 by late 2025. Traders in the fast-moving currency options market were late on Tuesday pricing a 56% probability of the euro being higher than its current level of about $1.047 at year-end, despite big banks like JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank saying a move to $1 could happen, depending on tariffs. Rising bets on the European Central Bank lowering rates by half a percentage point to 2.75% next month have weakened the euro. But a popular market narrative that Trump's aggressive growth policies and import taxes will boost U.S. inflation and keep rates high and the dollar mighty is also starting to fray. Eurizon SJL Capital CEO Stephen Jen said the U.S. risked a so-called bond vigilante moment if the White House's lenders in the $27 trillion Treasury market push debt costs higher to try and curb tax cuts funded by excessive borrowing. A consequent tightening of financial conditions \"should allow a soft landing in the U.S. economy and lower long-term interest rates,\" he said, making the dollar overvalued.

That said, paraphrasing the late American playwright Gertrude Stein, I argue \u201cthere\u2019s a there there.\u201d Gabe Kaminsky, writing for the Washington Examiner reported: \u201cIn October, weeks before the 2024 election, the word was out: Vice President Kamala Harris had fundraised north of $1 billion. The haul, the New York Times reported upon breaking the news, was historic because of the short period of time, just three months, that it flooded in.\u201d She didn\u2019t enter the race until late July 2024. And yet, somehow she ended up $20 million in a hole, unable even to pay off vendors. Harris\u2019 spending could be a remake of the late Richard Pryor film classic, \u201cBrewster\u2019s Millions,\u201d in which Pryor\u2019s character had to spend $30 million dollars in 30 days and have nothing to show for it, in order to inherit $300 million. Shamelessly, immediately following her drubbing election defeat by President Trump, Harris was sending out emails begging for small money donations to help pay off the debt, under the guise of the \u201cHarris Fight Fund\u201d program, to \u201cdefend democracy against President Trump.\u201d I\u2019ve personally received several such emails from her. Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet \u2013 delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! I\u2019m convinced something is amiss here, and for no shortage of reasons. I find it hard to believe that none of the Democrat prognosticators analyzed her chances of wining against President Trump concluded that she had only the remotest chance of winning, especially considering her massively poor past campaign performance. The Harris effort was without question the poorest exhibition of a presidential campaign in election history. She didn\u2019t campaign; she cackled and lied. She will go down in history as the best example of how to lose an election. So, what happened to the billion-plus dollars? I think a forensic accounting should take place. It is inconceivable to me that Democrats would dump over a billion dollars into a campaign that any analysis would should she didn\u2019t have a chance of winning. This despite the lapdog media and fake polls claiming the race was close. They made the same claims when Hillary Clinton ran and got trampled by President Trump. This would not be the first time Democrats have misdirected money into backdoor payola. In my May 17, 2012, syndicated op-ed, titled, \u201cAnother \u2018View\u2019 Of Obama\u2019s Hypocrisy,\u201d I wrote: I want to know why he sees the need for more banking regulations because JP Morgan lost money on a legitimate business venture that was between them and their investors \u2013 yet he views himself as above such accountability. He has squandered perhaps as much as $10 billion of our hard-earned tax dollars on Solyndra and 11 other green energy companies. The money JP Morgan lost was a gamble pursuant to what they do. They are in business to take informed risks that, if successful, will make their stockholders money. Obama was not elected to pass around our money to those he determines to be worthy. That, in and of itself, is illegal. Government is constitutionally forbidden from favoring one sector and\/or one business over another; it must treat all equally. Yet not only does Obama do it, but he doubles down on it. How about we demand investigations into that practice? Here\u2019s another example forensic accountants should have been tasked with investigating. Dec. 12, 2013, I reported about the $677 million cost of the Obamacare website. I wrote in my syndicated op-ed: I suspect that a portion of American tax dollars that paid for the website, which was awarded to the Canadian company CGI in a no-bid contract and that has as their senior vice-president the classmate and friend of Michelle Obama, Toni Townes-Whitley, was intended as payola for the reputation hit that the company would suffer in the short run by building a website that wasn\u2019t supposed to work right away. I suspect another portion of the $677 million is going to be funneled back into the Obama\u2019s pockets by way of charitable donations from CGI to various interests of the Obamas, in this case specifically Michelle Obama\u2019s. And for good reason: The \u201cbride of obama\u201d knows the true extent of the dirt Obama doesn\u2019t want revealed; thus, it is important to keep her happy. I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t raise the specter of another possibility. A colleague shared with me that they think an investigation should be done to see if portions of the billion-plus dollars were redirected to malevolent radical anarchist groups. Personally, I would question if any of the money was redirected to secret government programs for illegal aliens. Wouldn\u2019t it be worth the cost of a forensic accounting investigation to see if and\/or how much of the more than $1 billion was secretly diverted through the Harris campaign to provide for illegals? Jose Ibarra, the illegal alien who savagely attempted to rape and ultimately murdered Laken Riley, was flown on a jet for free by the Biden\/Harris administration from New York to Georgia. The money for his flight came from somewhere. It\u2019s a sure bet that Democrats wouldn\u2019t want you and I to know they are using our tax dollars to fund secret programs for illegals, especially while we\u2019re being priced into oblivion. I put nothing past the federal government especially under Obama\/Biden and Harris. Something happened to the money. You don\u2019t just spend a billion plus dollars in three months giving money to \u201cOkra\u201d Winfrey et al.

The European Central Bank warned on Wednesday that indices\u2019 increased dependence on a few mega-cap stocks \u201craises concerns over the possibility of an AI-related asset price bubble\u201d, but America\u2019s biggest bank is more sanguine in its 2025 outlook. Yes, the biggest stocks are doing the heavy lifting, with JPMorgan noting the so-called magnificent seven stocks now account for 35 per cent of the S&P 500, and 70 per cent of index returns since the beginning of 2023. Furthermore, the 10 largest stocks trade on 29 times estimated earnings, compared to 19 for the rest of the index \u2013 a valuation gap JPMorgan sees as \u201cunsustainable\u201d. If AI delivers on its promise, the broader market should eventually catch up; if AI\u2019s practical applications remain limited, a \u201ccatch-down\u201d correction is likely. However, strong fundamentals mean a big \u201ccatch-down\u201d is unlikely. The magnificent seven hold $460 billion on their balance sheets. Extremely low interest rates on Apple\u2019s corporate bonds maturing in 2032 reveal investors\u2019 faith. And unlike the late 1990s dotcom bubble, rising share prices are supported by earnings growth. Amazon shares are up 46 per cent over the last year but huge earnings growth means its price-earnings ratio has fallen from 48 to 35. Meta shares are up 78 per cent, but it still trades on just 24 times estimated earnings. Nvidia\u2019s surging share price has been accompanied by rocketing earnings. Alphabet, Apple, and Microsoft\u2019s valuations are little changed from a year ago. \u201cIn other words,\u201d says JPMorgan, \u201cwhat we are seeing today is reality over hope, rather than the hope over reality that prevailed during the dotcom bubble\u201d.

U.S. President-elect Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, plans to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and slap \"an additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs\" on China, hurting the positive market sentiment following the nomination of Scott Bessent as U.S. Treasury secretary. The dollar rose, while global equity markets declined. [MKTS\/GLOB] \"We've seen this movie before and it's going be negotiating tool, however we can't dismiss it entirely because this time Trump has full support of both the houses\" of the U.S. Congress, said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group. \"Investors have learned something from before and jumping like a frightened cat at every Trump headline is not going to be the way to get through this.\" The pan-European STOXX 600 was down 0.5%, snapping a three-day winning streak, with concerns over tariffs re-stoking global inflation and weighing on monetary-policy easing also dampening investors' mood. China-exposed stocks were the most affected on the index. The auto sector, expected to be among the worst hit under Trump tariffs, was down 1.6%, with Stellantis (NYSE:STLA) and Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) among the top losers, shedding 4.8% and 2.4%, respectively.  Retail and miners were some of the other badly hit sectors, down 1% and 1.9% respectively, with the latter taking a hit on weak metal prices. [MET\/L] \"European carmakers have seen clear weakness in their sales over the past few years and they have also been in the crossfire with the Chinese trade tensions... They are no longer in a position to afford additional tariffs,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. The European Central Bank's policymakers also are concerned about Trump tariffs.  The momentum in European stocks has stalled in the final stages of the year as investors grapple with the likely impact of trade tariffs, sagging Chinese spending and heightened geopolitical tensions, among other factors.  After hitting record highs earlier in 2024, the STOXX 600 is up just 6% this year, much behind the over 25% gains in the U.S. S&P 500.  Among specific stocks, Avolta fell 5.4% to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after  Barclays  (LON:BARC) downgraded the Swiss duty-free retailer's stock to \"underweight\" from \"overweight\".  Amundi lost 5.3% after two brokerages cut their rating to \"neutral\".  Meanwhile,  Melrose  (LON:MRON) Industries led gains on the STOXX 600, rising 7.7%, after J.P. Morgan upgraded its target price on the aerospace part maker's stock."},{"source":"Freerepublic.com","author":"Townhall","title":"Trump, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Reportedly Have Been In Talks Through 'Secret Back Channels' For Months","description":"Incoming President Donald Trump and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon have quietly been in talks for months through secret back channels, serving as the \u201csounding board\u201d for the 47th president\u2019s pending economic agenda.

Four sources close to the incoming Trump Administration confirmed that the president-elect and Dimon discussed issues before and after the election, such as reducing government spending, tax policy, trade, and banking regulations. The GOP insiders told the New York Post that Trump\u2019s aides regularly set up phone calls to \u201ccreate a bit of daylight\u201d between Trump and Dimon and prevent any information from reaching the press. The calls between Trump and the Wall Street mogul were \u201cno-holds-barred conversations.\u201d Dimon was floated as a potential pick as Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary at the time. However, despite calling Dimon a \u201chighly overrated Globalist\u201d in the past, Trump said he respected the banking CEO and dismissed rumors that he would serve in the Trump Administration. Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"I thank Jamie for his outstanding service to our Country!\u201d In response, Dimon replied, \u201cI haven't had a boss in 25 years, and I'm not about ready to start.\" Instead, Trump nominated Key Square founder Scott Bessent as his pick for Treasury secretary.

The GOP insiders told the New York Post that Trump\u2019s aides regularly set up phone calls to \u201ccreate a bit of daylight\u201d between Trump and Dimon and prevent any information from reaching the press. The calls between Trump and the Wall Street mogul were \u201cno-holds-barred conversations.\u201d Dimon was floated as a potential pick as Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary at the time. However, despite calling Dimon a \u201chighly overrated Globalist\u201d in the past, Trump said he respected the banking CEO and dismissed rumors that he would serve in the Trump Administration. Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"I thank Jamie for his outstanding service to our Country!\u201d In response, Dimon replied, \u201cI haven't had a boss in 25 years, and I'm not about ready to start.\" Instead, Trump nominated Key Square founder Scott Bessent as his pick for Treasury secretary.

While he also acknowledged job displacement risks, Dimon chose to stress the historical benefits of technology, it reported. Speaking to Bloomberg TV, Dimon said thousands at JP Morgan are already using AI, adding that the technology is evolving and \u00a0a \u201cliving breathing thing\u201d. But Dimon sought to move away from the pessimistic views on AI, adding that AI and large language models (LLMs) provide opportunities to improve living standards, as per the report. \u201cPeople have to take a deep breath. Technology has always replaced jobs. Your children are going to live to 100 and not have cancer because of technology, and literally, they\u2019ll probably be working three and a half days a week,\u201d he told the channel. On the threat of job loss, Dimon was of the view that while disruptions from technology are expected, he hopes to move employees pushed out of a job because of AI to another role instead of firing them, Fortune reported. He compared JPMorgan\u2019s acquisition of First Republic in 2023 to AI disruption, stating, \u201cAt First Republic we\u2019ve offered jobs to 90 per cent of people. They accepted, but we also told them some of those jobs are transitory. But we hire 30,000 people a year, so we expect to be able to get them a job somewhere local in a different branch or a different function if we can do that. We\u2019ll be doing that with any dislocation that takes place as a result of AI,\u201d Dimon said. He also added that the technology could lead to \u201cnegatives\u201d if \u201cused by bad people\u201d. \u201cTechnology has done unbelievable things for mankind, but you know, planes crash, and pharmaceuticals get misused\u2014there are negatives. This one, the biggest negative in my view, is AI being used by bad people to do bad things. Think of cyber warfare,\u201d he added.

Investors were surprised by an announcement that tax exemptions would rise, and worried that the government was relying on overly optimistic fiscal projections. The Brazilian real ended at its weakest closing level ever at 5.99 per dollar. Interest rate futures rose further and the Bovespa stock index fell some 2%.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said the highly anticipated measures to curb expenditures were overshadowed by income tax reform plans aimed at easing the burden on the middle-class. It said this limited credibility of the measures and necessitated a firmer response from the central bank. Uncertainty over the fiscal outlook had already led the central bank to call for structural measures to control spending, accelerating its tightening pace in November with a 50 basis-point hike that brought interest rates to 11.25%. \"We now see the central bank hiking rates by 100 basis points in the next meeting,\" said JP Morgan, adding it viewed the government's fiscal estimates as too optimistic. Finance Minister Fernando Haddad sought to calm the market following a meltdown on Wednesday over announcement of a proposal to increase the income tax exemption threshold for those earning up to 5,000 reais per month from 2,824 reais. After weeks of delays, markets had expected the package to focus exclusively on spending cuts, consistent with previous statements by Haddad. Those statements had suggested that the government would wait until next year to propose changes in tax exemptions to fulfill a campaign promise by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.  On Thursday, Haddad told a press conference that the broader income exemptions would carry a 35 billion reais fiscal impact that would be fully neutralized by compensatory measures, taking effect only in 2026 after Congressional approval. COMPENSATIONS The government said around half of the compensation would come from setting a higher effective tax rate for the wealthiest.  The proposal would hike the effective income tax rate for those earning more than 600,000 reais per year. The rate would reach 10% for individuals earning over 1 million reais annually. The current effective tax rate is 4.2% for the top 1% of earners and 1.75% for the top 0.01%, government figures showed. To cover the remaining fiscal hit, the government would end the income tax exemption for retirees with severe illnesses or who suffered accidents and who earn above 20,000 reais per month, among other measures.  Media reports of a coming increase in the income tax exemption had already soured market sentiment even before the official announcement. Haddad said the U.S. dollar had been strengthening globally, and that inflation in Brazil is expected to end the year within or very close to the official target range of 1.5% to 4.5%.  \"The market needs to read again what the government is doing. They've been wrong in terms of growth and deficit (projections),\" Haddad said. \"Our work is not done. I don't believe in silver bullets. I'm happy with this year's results.\" ($1 = 5.9377 reais)"},{"source":"Investing.com","author":"Investing.com","title":"Truist financial CEO William H Jr. Rogers buys $1.66 million in stock","description":"Truist financial CEO William H Jr. Rogers buys $1.66 million in stock","url":"https:\/\/www.investing.com\/news\/insider-trading-news\/truist-financial-ceo-william-h-jr-rogers-buys-166-million-in-stock-93CH-3744393","published_at":"2024-11-27T13:15:57Z","content":"William H. Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Jr., Chairman and CEO of Truist Financial Corp (NYSE:NYSE:TFC), recently acquired 34,180 shares of the company's common stock, amounting to a total value of approximately $1.66 million. The shares were purchased at a price of $48.56 each. Following this transaction, Rogers holds a direct ownership of 691,450.644 shares. Additionally, he maintains indirect ownership of shares through various trusts and a 401(k) plan. This transaction was reported in a recent SEC filing, highlighting Rogers' continued investment in Truist Financial.   In other recent news, Truist Financial Corporation has undergone significant changes in its leadership team. Brad Bender has been appointed as the new chief risk officer following the retirement of Clarke R. Starnes III. Kerry Jessani, a veteran from JP Morgan, has been appointed as the head of mid-corporate banking. These appointments are part of recent developments in the corporation. Truist reported a GAAP net income of $1.3 billion or $0.99 per share for the third quarter of 2024. The adjusted earnings per share stood at $0.97, reflecting a 2.4% increase in adjusted revenue, primarily driven by investment banking and trading. RBC Capital Markets reiterated an Outperform rating on Truist Financial following these robust results. The corporation also announced dividends for its common and various series of preferred stock. Furthermore, Truist has launched a substantial stock repurchase program, with $500 million worth of shares already repurchased in the third quarter and plans for an additional $500 million in repurchases in the fourth quarter. Other recent developments include a $25 million loan loss provision related to Hurricane Helene and a projected 1.5% decrease in revenue for Q4 2024 due to lower commercial loan balances. Truist is focusing on expanding client relationships post-merger and plans to maintain an elevated level of $500 million in buybacks for the foreseeable future, as noted by analysts from RBC Capital and other firms.   William H. Rogers Jr.'s recent acquisition of Truist Financial Corp (NYSE:TFC) shares aligns with several positive indicators highlighted by InvestingPro. The CEO's $1.66 million investment comes at a time when TFC is trading near its 52-week high, with the stock price at 97.23% of its peak. This bullish sentiment is further supported by the company's strong performance, as evidenced by a 59.75% total return over the past year. InvestingPro Tips suggest that Truist Financial has maintained dividend payments for an impressive 52 consecutive years, demonstrating a commitment to shareholder value that complements Rogers' increased stake. Additionally, the company's high shareholder yield and the expectation of net income growth this year paint a positive picture for investors. From a valuation perspective, TFC's adjusted P\/E ratio of 4.0 for the last twelve months as of Q3 2024 indicates that the stock may be undervalued relative to its earnings potential. This could explain Rogers' decision to increase his holdings at the current price point. It's worth noting that InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for Truist Financial, providing investors with a more comprehensive analysis of the company's prospects. Those seeking a deeper understanding of TFC's financial health and market position may find value in exploring these additional insights.

Europe's single currency has slumped by just over 3% against the dollar in November. It is now teetering towards the key $1 mark, pressured by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's proposed trade tariffs, euro zone economic weakness and an escalating Russia\/Ukraine conflict, just as U.S. growth bets lift U.S. stocks and the dollar. France's political woes are another potential headwind, with French consumer confidence at a five-month low and the fate of the new government and its budget at risk. Investors and currency traders, however, are divided about what comes next because the dollar is also vulnerable to inflationary tariffs and government debt increases shaking faith in U.S. markets and the economy.  This uncertainty could increase if the euro drops further, raising the threat level for unexpected currency shifts that could upend highly popular so-called Trump trades, which bank on the euro falling as U.S. stocks rise, analysts said.  \"We'll get volatility because people will start to think: Are we breaking through (euro-dollar) parity or will it snap back?\" Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) head of FX strategy Kit Juckes said.  \"The minimum we will see is more debate in both directions about the euro and I don't trust these extraordinarily high levels of cross-asset correlations to continue.\" August's market rout began with yen-dollar swings that caught hedge funds betting against the Japanese currency off guard and swelled into stock market selling to fund margin calls.  Regulators have warned about market fragility to similar events when popular market narratives rapidly shift, because of high levels of leverage in the system.  \"If we crash through (euro-dollar) parity we'll be having those kinds of conversations again,\" Juckes said.  SPILLOVERS The euro-dollar is the world's most actively traded currency pair and rapid exchange rate shifts can disrupt multinationals' earnings and the growth and inflation outlook for nations that import commodities and export goods priced in dollars.  \"The euro is a benchmark,\"  Barclays  (LON:BARC) global head of FX strategy Themos Fiotakis said, meaning trade sensitive nations such as China, South Korea and Switzerland could allow their currencies to weaken against the dollar if the euro dropped further so they can compete with euro zone exports.  Britain's pound, down just over 2% against the dollar this month to around $1.26, is highly sensitive to euro moves, he added. Market sensitivity to the euro-dollar rate has also risen after what currency strategists said was a rush by traders into options contracts that combine bets on cross-asset outcomes from Trump's policies, such as the euro weakening and the S&P rising.  \"We've seen a lot of people trying to invest in (these) conditional outcomes,\" Fiotakis said, which could raise the correlations between currency moves and wider markets.  Investors were underestimating that risk, UBS strategist Alvise Marino said.  A gauge of investor demand for protection against near-term euro-dollar swings is trading around 8%, well below a level of almost 14% when the euro last slumped below $1 in October 2022.  \"Realised volatility in FX is likely to be high, and certainly higher than markets are pricing in,\" Marino said.  He is recommending clients hedge against currency swings via derivatives contracts that pay out if euro volatility is higher a year from now.  SPLIT VIEWS  Long term asset managers, meanwhile, are deeply divided on where the euro and the dollar go from here, underscoring how this crucial exchange rate could be set for a bumpy ride in coming months.  \"We are looking for the euro to go to 99 cents by the middle of the next year,\" said Willem Sels, global chief investment officer at HSBC's private banking and wealth unit.  But Vincent Mortier, chief investment officer of Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager, said euro zone rate cuts could boost euro zone business and consumer spending and lift the euro to $1.16 by late 2025. Traders in the fast-moving currency options market were late on Tuesday pricing a 56% probability of the euro being higher than its current level of about $1.047 at year-end, despite big banks like JP Morgan and  Deutsche Bank  (ETR:DBKGn) saying a move to $1 could happen, depending on tariffs.  Rising bets on the European Central Bank lowering rates by half a percentage point to 2.75% next month have weakened the euro.  But a popular market narrative that Trump's aggressive growth policies and import taxes will boost U.S. inflation and keep rates high and the dollar mighty is also starting to fray.   Eurizon SJL Capital CEO Stephen Jen said the U.S. risked a so-called bond vigilante moment if the White House's lenders in the $27 trillion Treasury market push debt costs higher to try and curb tax cuts funded by excessive borrowing.  A consequent tightening of financial conditions \"should allow a soft landing in the U.S. economy and lower long-term interest rates,\" he said, making the dollar overvalued."},{"source":"Investing.com","author":"Investing.com","title":"Brightcove agrees to $233 million buyout by Bending Spoons","description":"Brightcove agrees to $233 million buyout by Bending Spoons","url":"https:\/\/www.investing.com\/news\/company-news\/brightcove-agrees-to-233-million-buyout-by-bending-spoons-93CH-3739436","published_at":"2024-11-25T13:13:03Z","content":"BOSTON - Brightcove Inc. (NASDAQ: BCOV), a prominent streaming technology company, has announced an agreement to be acquired by Bending Spoons, a technology firm with a global footprint in digital products. The all-cash transaction is valued at approximately $233 million. Brightcove stockholders are set to receive $4.45 per share, a 90% premium over the company's 60-day volume-weighted average share price as of November 22, 2024. Diane Hessan, Chairman of Brightcove's Board of Directors, stated that the board's unanimous decision to accept Bending Spoons' offer came after a thorough strategic review process. This move is seen as the optimal path to maximize value for Brightcove's stockholders by providing immediate cash value. Brightcove's CEO, Marc DeBevoise, highlighted the company's pioneering role in the streaming market over the past two decades and expressed confidence that the acquisition would allow Brightcove to leverage Bending Spoons' technology expertise to further its market position. The transaction, which has received unanimous approval from Brightcove's Board of Directors, is expected to finalize in the first half of 2025, pending customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals, and approval by Brightcove's stockholders. Following the completion of the deal, Brightcove will operate as a privately held entity and its shares will be delisted from public stock exchanges. Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) and Goodwin Procter LLP are advising Brightcove on the financial and legal aspects of the transaction, respectively. Bending Spoons has engaged Latham & Watkins LLP for legal advice, with EY Advisory SpA providing financial and tax due diligence services. M&A advice for Bending Spoons is being furnished by JP Morgan and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC). The proposed transaction is detailed in a proxy statement that Brightcove will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which will be provided to the company's stockholders in connection with a special meeting to seek their approval of the deal. This news article is based on a press release statement and does not contain any promotional content. It aims to provide a clear and factual summary of the acquisition agreement between Brightcove and Bending Spoons.   In other recent news, Brightcove Inc. reported a strong financial performance in its Q3 2024 Earnings Call, exceeding forecasts and raising its full-year outlook. The company's revenue for the quarter reached $49.9 million, outpacing the anticipated range of $48 million to $49 million. Additionally, Brightcove's adjusted EBITDA landed at $5.1 million, notably higher than the expected $2.5 million to $3.5 million.  These developments are attributed to strategic initiatives such as the launch of the Brightcove AI Suite and a significant growth in new business. The company plans to increase its full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance, reflecting these positive results. Brightcove also announced over 50% growth in new business quarter-over-quarter and reported more than 50 customers in pilot testing for the AI Suite.  Despite reporting a net loss of $3 million for the quarter, the company remains debt-free with a strong cash position. Looking ahead, Brightcove targets Q4 revenue between $48 million and $49 million, with adjusted EBITDA of $3 million to $4 million. The company's 12-month backlog stands at $122.4 million, indicating future revenue stability.   As Brightcove Inc. (NASDAQ: BCOV) prepares for its acquisition by Bending Spoons, recent InvestingPro data offers additional context to this significant development. The company's market capitalization stands at $143.98 million, which is notably lower than the $233 million acquisition price, reflecting the substantial premium Bending Spoons is offering to shareholders. Brightcove's financial performance has been mixed, with revenue for the last twelve months as of Q3 2024 at $199.83 million, showing a slight decline of 0.22% year-over-year. This stagnation in revenue growth may have been a factor in the company's decision to pursue a strategic sale. Despite challenges, Brightcove maintains a solid gross profit margin of 61.65%, indicating strong underlying value in its core business. This robust margin likely contributed to Bending Spoons' interest in acquiring the company. InvestingPro Tips highlight additional aspects of Brightcove's financial situation: 1. Brightcove's stock price has shown strong momentum, with a 41.15% return over the past month and a 52.63% return over the last three months. This upward trend suggests that the market had begun to recognize the company's potential value even before the acquisition announcement. 2. Analysts have set a fair value of $4.25 per share for Brightcove, which aligns closely with the $4.45 per share offer from Bending Spoons, indicating that the acquisition price is in line with expert valuations. These insights from InvestingPro provide a deeper understanding of Brightcove's financial position and market perception leading up to the acquisition.

The rally created a spinning top candle, representing bull-bear equilibrium. Yesterday\u2019s gap-up means that 23,956 becomes critical support, a daily close below which will re-embolden bears. On the upside, 24,340 - 24,530 represents a pivotal hurdle area, followed by 24,700 - 24,800 where the 50-day and the 100-day averages are clustering. Bank Nifty began today\u2019s session with a gap-up at 52,555 versus previous session\u2019s close of 52,208. The index is currently hovering around 52,180.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average logged a record close on Monday, as U.S. Treasury bonds saw their biggest rally in nearly four months after President-elect Donald Trump selected Scott Bessent as his nominee for Treasury secretary. President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office as part of his efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices on everything from gas to automobiles. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday that on his first day in office he will impose a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. The announcement sparked a dollar rally. It rose 1% against the Canadian dollar and 2% against the Mexican peso, while share markets in Asia fell, as did European equity futures ratcheting up concerns about his America First policies. Crude oil prices on Monday settled sharply lower on the back of speculation over a cease-fire in Lebanon, combined with what appears to be restraint on the part of Iran. U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron are expected to announce a ceasefire in Lebanon between armed group Hezbollah and Israel imminently, four senior Lebanese sources said on Monday. Asian shares were mostly lower on Tuesday on the back of Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on China, which could have an impact on other Asian economies. Nifty rose again on Nov 25 adding nearly 4% in two consecutive sessions of gains to regain its losses on a month-on-month basis. At close, Nifty was up 1.32% or 314.7 points at 24221.9. A small negative candle was formed on the daily chart with upper and lower shadow. Technically, this pattern indicates an upside breakout for the Nifty with an unfilled opening upside gap. If this gap remains unfilled for the next few sessions, it may mean formation of an important bottom reversal for Nifty around 23263 levels. In the near term 24500 could still pose some resistance for the Nifty while 23900 could offer support.

The US election accelerates this trend. Looking forward, what are your expectations, particularly in terms of tariffs? President-elect Donald Trump has clearly announced last week the magnitude of tariffs that he has in mind: 60% for China, 10-20% for the rest of the world. But he has not been very specific about the scope and the basis on which those tariffs would apply. That\u2019s a really interesting area for clarification and better understanding. Tariffs applied on a broad, undiscriminating basis produce certain effects. But very selective, targeted tariffs will produce a different effect. Going forward, the scope of the tariffs will be really interesting to appreciate. It\u2019s one thing if you are raising your tariffs on certain product categories, as I think the US Administration has done for instance on electric vehicles. It\u2019s another if they\u2019re applied on a broad basis to anything that crosses the border. On these details we have no idea yet.  How should Europe respond?  As far as the tariffs on European imports are concerned \u2013 10-20% \u2013 there is a 100% difference between the two. That is also interesting. I think it\u2019s indicative of the approach allegedly often taken by President-elect Donald Trump, which consists of negotiating. The fact that you put out a range means that you are open to discussion. You\u2019re open to a different distribution of that tariff depending on what the base is going to be. The European Commission has flagged that it is preparing, which is good. We seem to err more on what I would call a cheque book strategy. We could offer to buy certain things from the United States and signal that we are prepared to sit at the table and see how we can work together. I think this is a better scenario than a pure retaliation strategy, which can lead to a tit-for-tat process where no one is really a winner.  Because that would mean a trade war with all sorts of consequences?  If it was a trade war at large, it would be net negative for all, not just for the targets of US tariffs. When you start considering a trade war, you can soon see an escalation, which in my view is a net negative. This can be in nobody\u2019s interest, neither for the United States nor for Europe, or anyone for that matter. This would induce a global reduction in GDP.  Some people in Europe argue that the best strategy is not to retaliate at all to potential Trump tariffs and just kind of take it on the chin. Do you agree? What happened last time around when there was a threat of tariffs on Europe \u2013 on all categories of steel \u2013 the approach taken by the European Commission was to sit down and talk. Not to retaliate, but to negotiate.  What could Europe offer in return? I\u2019m not the trade person, and in trade you really have to go to a very granular level. But in general, Europe could talk about buying more liquid natural gas from the United States. And obviously there is the whole category of defence goods, some of which we are not capable of manufacturing over here in Europe and which could be bought in a cohesive EU approach by Member States. What would a trade war mean for the ECB? How would it affect inflation?  That\u2019s a great question, which I\u2019m not sure that I have a complete answer to as yet because of the reasons that I have just mentioned. It would produce a variety of consequences, and the actual net impact on inflation is uncertain at this point. If you combine the decline of GDP and the potential depreciation or appreciation of the dollar, it\u2019s extremely difficult to assess. And you also have to establish what is short term and what is not so short term before you can get to any real ultimate and conclusive answer. If anything, maybe it\u2019s a little net inflationary in the short term. But you could argue both ways; it depends what the tariffs are, what they are applied on and over what period of time.  Is Europe potentially more affected by the United States-China trade war than direct tariffs against its imports to the United States?  That\u2019s an interesting question. Think about the discrepancy of level in the tariffs on goods from China and other countries. I\u2019m not suggesting that Europe is at a competitive advantage, but there is certainly a stronger weight put on Chinese exports to the United States by Trump. What we need to be mindful of and we need to monitor carefully is the \u201crerouting scenario\u201d. Some of these Chinese-made products, which will obviously be less competitive on US markets, will try to find its way somewhere else \u2013 and that certainly could be the third largest economic zone in the world: Europe. It will also concern not just Europe, but all potential purchasers outside the United States.  Should Europe then protect its markets with protective tariffs against Chinese goods?  Free trade with China is more attractive if it\u2019s reciprocal and beneficial for both. Otherwise, the risk is that tariffs will be raised by Europe, as has already happened in the case of electric vehicles. It could happen in an interim phase. But I see this as a risk because escalating tariffs is neither an ultimate nor an optimal solution. There is a cost to fragmentation and uncertainty, isn\u2019t there? Of course. The level of uncertainty pre-existed the US election and has been factored into our own projections already. Maybe not all of it, but a large portion of that uncertainty was factored into the September projections. It will be factored into the December projections. That uncertainty leads to reduced confidence. If you look at the various consumer morale surveys and business confidence surveys, it\u2019s clearly reflected in consumption and investment decisions, which are withheld as a result.  So far, both in Europe and the United States, while attempting to decouple, everyone seems to have ended up de-risking instead. Do you think that\u2019s where we are heading?  Decoupling is probably the incoming US government\u2019s intention. The question is: will it be an orderly or a disorderly decoupling? Clearly, the European Commission\u2019s intention was de-risking, and the [US] Treasury under its current leadership has been focused on de-risking. But the blunt announcement of 60% tariffs on anything coming from China does not sound very much like de-risking.  In January you called Trump a threat for Europe? How do you feel about that remark today?  It was prescient. Just look at the debates that we are having in many countries in Europe. Do you still think he\u2019s a threat for Europe? Actually, my thinking has changed a bit. It is up to us now \u2013 the Europeans \u2013 to transform that threat attitude of ours into a challenge that we have to respond to. I have been focusing on the areas that are the most relevant ones for us here in my capacity. I have been advocating strongly and will continue to advocate strongly that we get on with implementing and executing on the good intentions of the capital markets union. And I think that money matters, people matter, energy matters. As far as money is concerned, we have to move quickly with the capital markets union. And I see those promised US policies as an accelerator of a reset that we need in Europe.  You have been talking about the capital markets union for a very long time, but it\u2019s not happening. What will it actually take for the capital markets union to become a reality?  I have not seen such a level of understanding and excitement as we have now: look at the Draghi report, the Letta report, the Noyer report. Some leaders are now saying: if we cannot all agree in the EU, then it should be a qualified majority, and if we cannot have a qualified majority, we should go for enhanced cooperation. EU rules allow for that. I know it\u2019s controversial, but we should start with really transforming the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and making sure that it operates like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US. Instead of having 27 capital market supervisory authorities, we should have one single supervisor. How we integrate the 27 existing ones in the Member States is what needs to be defined. There can be structures where they are part and parcel of a single supervisory mechanism, but they refer not to the local finance ministry but to the central supervisory authority.  Getting the capital markets union done is a big idea in theory, but....  ... it\u2019s a massive endeavour, I agree with you. But if we don\u2019t start with the money, it will not trigger the rest, which has to come as well, like securitisation. It\u2019s important for the banks to have space on their balance sheet, to continue to finance innovation using different instruments. But I would start with something that is the catalyst, which is common supervision. And, frankly, we can learn from the Single Supervisory Mechanism. Ten years ago, important people said, \u201cNever! No way will we ever see bank supervision conducted on systemic international institutions centrally.\u201d And well, guess what? Ten years later, the supervision is conducted through the Single Supervisory Mechanism and involves the national authorities. It is laborious, but it\u2019s working.  But given the state of European economies today, the threat of uncertainty that will emanate from the United States, your proposal can only be a starting point, right? This is one of many things that needs to happen in Europe. Did you agree with the Draghi report? Do you think it was a fair assessment?  Yes, generally I mean. We could nitpick some details and a couple of controversial sections. But generally, I agree with the diagnosis that he has.  What about common debt? Well, that\u2019s the only issue that Mario Draghi himself has said: Don\u2019t even consider that as the most relevant proposal. Look at everything else. And once we\u2019ve agreed on everything else, then we\u2019ll come to how we finance it. And you know what\u2019s funny: the media has focused on common debt. But nobody has picked up on the fact that he\u2019s recommending that 80% of the total investment be privately funded and 20% be publicly funded, and that we need a blend of the two to actually make things happen.  Would you call the current situation a European crisis?  No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a crisis. I think it\u2019s an awakening. It\u2019s a big awakening. But the gap with the United States has widened over time.  Yes, it has widened over the last 30 years. So you could argue that we\u2019ve been in crisis for 30 years, which I don\u2019t think has been the case. We have missed the transformative impact of the first IT revolution. In the 1990s, the United States rode with it and in that particular field we have lost competitiveness.  We\u2019re now in a second phase of digital disruption, but with AI. And again, the United States and China are way, way ahead of Europe.  I wouldn\u2018t give up on Europe on that one. Companies in the United States and at least one, if not two, in China have invested massively in artificial intelligence. Europe is lagging behind. But I wouldn\u2018t say that Europe cannot catch up. There are many companies in Europe.  If they stay independent... That\u2018s the challenge for the European companies. Can we actually keep financing them, helping them and giving them the freedom and space to innovate and to continue to be champions in their respective fields? Just look at the trading rooms and the financial environment in London back in the 2000s \u2013 they were staffed with French people. Where did they come from? From the best schools in France that produced [people] who could invent algorithms and financial instruments, sometimes to their own peril. This shows that the brainpower \u2013 the capacity to focus on what is needed to produce those large language models and to run them \u2013 exists in our countries. We have people in the United Kingdom and France and other places. We just need to make sure that they stay here longer, that they get their financing from here and then expand here. That\u2019s a challenge, granted.  Finance is another sector that has been left behind. Back in 2008, a lot of European banks were on a par with US banks. Now, the average European bank is typically one-tenth the size of a JP Morgan or a Goldman Sachs. When you look at one of the rare attempts to create a European bank through the merger of UniCredit and Commerzbank \u2013 and you see pushback that\u2019s come from politicians \u2013 does that not show that Europe is never going to make up the ground? I prefer not to comment on a particular case which is ongoing. I have said publicly that cross-border mergers in general would be beneficial if they produce added value. There\u2019s a lot of weakness and fragmentation in European politics. You\u2019ve argued that the EU needs to act more like the eurozone \u2013 as one large economy rather than a collection of economies. But that is more difficult to do today, partly because of politics, isn\u2019t it?  Things happen in this part of the world when Member States come together. And for them to come together, it\u2019s helpful when the two largest players [Germany and France] form common views on key issues. We don\u2019t have a lot of that at the moment, granted. And there is political uncertainty because of upcoming elections in Germany and the current situation of the French government. But I would also observe that whenever we had to reckon with adversity \u2013 whether it was COVID, whether it was the financial crisis back in 2008 \u2013 Europe came together. In French we would say \u201cn\u00e9cessit\u00e9 fait loi\u201d \u2013 necessity is the mother of invention.  Can we maybe go back to the start of the conversation: trade and fragmentation of the global economy? We\u2019ve talked about short-term potential economic consequences. Let\u2019s look at the longer-term picture. We know that world trade has been one of the key engines of economic growth globally over recent decades. In this potential new world of tariffs and fragmentation, we might lose out. Europe is already lagging behind in terms of growth. How gloomy do you think the medium to long-term outlook for Europe is?  In the long term, tariffs will be negative for global growth. That\u2019s always been the case: if you raise tariffs on a global basis, it reduces global GDP across the board. I find it difficult to reconcile myself with the proposal to \u201cmake America great again\u201d. How do you make America great again if global demand is falling? Particularly if that happens at a time when there is not that much slack in the US economy, which limits the space to respond to disappearing imported supply. That\u2019s why we really need to understand the scope, the target and the pace [of tariffs] to measure the impact and to really appreciate what it will be.  I\u2019d also like to address the idea that Europe, as a more open economy than the United States and China, is more vulnerable as a result. What is also the case is that Europe is the world\u2019s third largest economy and it trades quite a lot with itself. It doesn\u2019t suffer a particular exchange rate risk in that respect.  You also made a speech the other day about Europe\u2019s social contract. Europe appears to have agreed on a trade-off to have better social services and less animal spirits and innovation. There is a lot of standard-setting and regulation. Does this trade-off have to be re-examined as part of Europe\u2019s awakening? I think the equilibrium that we have had for a long time needs to be re-examined. Does that mean that we should give up on that trade-off that you referred to, which is essentially to do with the distribution of wealth, with inequality versus equality? I\u2019m not saying that I advocate for pure equality at all, but I do think that that trade-off is integral to the European fabric. And it has nothing to do with the other element, which we can certainly improve, in fact we should definitely do so.  If I\u2019m to believe the CEOs and businesspeople that we see and listen to on a regular basis, then bureaucracy, overregulation and paperwork, in digital form or otherwise, is really a burden on them. That has nothing to do with the trade-off between inequality and equality. There is a degree of regulation where businesses are benefiting \u2013 certainly in businesses that benefit from implicit state guarantees like the banking sector \u2013 and which is legitimate. But going way beyond that \u2013 as European institutions have done regularly \u2013 needs to be addressed.  That\u2019s what I mean by accelerating the resetting of Europe. Can Europe be not just a machine that produces regulation, but a landscape where innovation is encouraged by a reset of its key actors?  In the climate space companies complain a lot about regulation. It\u2019s great that Europe is a standard-setter but, at the same time, the number of regulations is a big burden on business. I agree with that. And I believe that the various teams working on these issues have to come together and produce a standardised set of disclosure and transition plans. Currently you have at least four different bases on which disclosure plans have to be submitted by companies, which then pass them on to banks. There are lots of other requirements in that field and they need to be harmonised. It cannot be that companies \u2013 particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \u2013 have to produce a plethora of different disclosures on their environmental footprint. When I say that, I have colleagues who say: \"Well, but SMEs are exempt.\" No, they're not, because the big corporations have to check with all the SME that are their subcontractors where these business partners produce, whether there is deforestation involved, whether they do this and this and that, in order to combine everything and then report back. We have to all agree with the standards and the direction we are heading, but we have to completely harmonise this massive burden of paperwork that exists.   Do you worry that the divergence with the US on issues like the Basel III implementation is going to create a lot more difficulty for the business community? Should Europe respond to that?  I think the jury's out on Basel III. You might be right, and that would not be a good outcome because there has been so much effort and so many years put into trying to harmonise the framework in which banks operate. So it would be a pity, not so much because of the sunk work done so far, but because we would lose that harmonisation of principles and the level playing field that everybody aspired to.  How do you feel about the view that Europe has become a museum? It\u2019s a pretty attractive museum if you ask me. ... On a serious note, I think it\u2019s a very self-deprecating view. We tend to see ourselves as this wonderful museum, this wonderful home for wealthy retirees. But when you go around Europe, when you try to find out what\u2019s going on, there is also a huge amount of innovation. For instance, I was talking to Dutch members of the European Parliament recently. Did you know that the Netherlands is the second-largest farming product exporter in the world? Look at the size of the country! Everybody always marvels about other small countries that innovate massively in agriculture. The Netherlands stands head and shoulders above that.  But Dutch tomatoes taste awful.  But you eat them.  What do you think about the push for deregulation from the incoming US administration and the stock market response, which so far has been very positive? Some people say this might be a sugar rush and could eventually result in a crisis that might be even worse than the global financial crisis. Do you agree?  We have been saying for the last couple of years now that there could be a market price adjustment. There has been a little bit of it and there will be more. But to assume that we will have a financial crisis as a result of the deregulation attempt \u2013 I don\u2019t see that. We stand ready anyway.

This was granted by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) and the Autoriteit Financi\u00eble Markten (AFM). With this approval, Cboe Clear Europe is set to introduce a first-of-its-kind service for European SFT transactions in cash equities and ETFs, which includes central clearing, settlement and post-trade lifecycle management. It is available to principal lenders, special participant lenders (UCITS and non-UCITS) and borrowers, with settlements conducted across 19 European Central Securities Depositories (CSDs). The service supports key regulatory initiatives such as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), Central Securities Depositary Regime (CSDR) and the Securities Financing Transactions Regulation (SFTR), thereby promoting transparency, market integrity and the competitiveness of European capital markets. \"We are delighted to have received regulatory approval to expand into European SFT clearing, marking a significant milestone in our goal to introduce innovative, robust, and comprehensive clearing solutions across multiple asset classes in Europe,\" said Vikesh Patel, President of Cboe Clear Europe. \"This achievement underscores our dedication to supporting our clients' evolving needs and contributing to the resilience of financial markets. We greatly appreciate the support of our regulators as we deliver on our commitment to launch innovative services which we believe enhance efficiencies for European market participants and help foster the growth of the region's capital markets.\" This service will help to transform the current bilateral process between securities lenders and borrowers into a centrally cleared model, with Cboe Clear Europe acting as the counterparty to both sides of each transaction. We believe this enables participants to reduce their risk-weighted asset exposures associated with SFTs and supports the growth of this key market. Additionally, it is expected to bring various capital and operational advantages, including savings from cross-margining between cash equities and SFTs, greater settlement efficiencies, elimination of agent lender disclosures, and improved practices around fees management and corporate actions. The service will utilise The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation and J.P. Morgan as Tri-Party Collateral Agents, while Pirum will serve as the transmitter of new trade instructions and post-trade lifecycle events on behalf of clients. Jan Treuren, Senior Director, Product, Cboe Clear Europe, said: \"We are excited to build out this new clearing eco-system in collaboration with market participants and are already in advanced discussions with a wide variety of firms, including banks, asset managers, broker-dealers, and Agent Lenders - representing beneficial owners like pension funds and UCITS - to help ensure a smooth launch in the coming weeks and months. This service is supported by our best-in-class risk management framework, offering clients the advantage of Cboe Clear Europe's extensive settlement experience and broad direct connectivity to 19 European CSDs. Initially, the service will cover key European markets, with plans to expand the offering based on client demand and market developments.\" As a leading pan-European cash equities clearing house, Cboe Clear Europe currently provides its services for 47 trading venues, achieving a record cash equity market share of 37.2%* in Q3 2024. The company enables Clearing Participants to manage their counterparty credit risk and also to maximise operational efficiencies through automated processing and the provision of netting opportunities. It diversified into equity derivatives clearing in 2021 to support the launch of Cboe Europe Derivatives (CEDX), Cboe's pan-European equity derivatives exchange, which includes equity index and single stock derivatives.

So far, it has deployed 90% of its $130 million second fund corpus. TCHF II has so far invested in nine companies across diverse segments of the healthcare sector, and is in the process of concluding a tenth investment in the medical consumables segment, Chandramouli told Mint. \n     \n      \u201cThis is a business where the macro theme is essentially the India indigenization story, where we are looking at local production for global products,\" Chandramouli said, adding that local players for global markets is a big shift happening in the medical technology space in India. \u201cThis is a company which is a leader in the select medical consumables category, having a very strong regulatory know-how, exports to over 50 countries, and reasonable growth as well as profitability,\" she said. Chandramouli declined to name the company or share more details, but said they plan to conclude the investment soon. \nIncreasing capitalGoing forward, TCHF is looking at increasing the capital deployed to address India\u2019s unmet healthcare needs. \u201cThe size of capital we\u2019ve been deploying so far has been in the $10-18 million range\u2026now potentially we should be looking at a much larger ticket size going forward, given the fact that the need is much more,\" Chandramouli said, adding that it would be in the over $25 million range in the future.\n\nAlso Read: Healthtech\u2019s latest buzzword is a relentless killerThe fund looks at bridging the gaps in India\u2019s healthcare space when building its portfolio. One of the fund's key focuses is on demographics, Chandramouli said. \u201cThere's a huge population which is above 60, nearly 160-170 million people, and there is no formal institutional care on that,\" she said.\n\n     \n      Spending on healthcare is also set to increase. \u201cEven the middle income households\u2026there will be an at least three-to-four times increase in health expenditure. So one needs to address that,\" she added.\n\n     \n      India's healthcare sector has been growing at a rapid pace. It grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22% between 2016 and 2022, a 2023 NITI Aayog paper said. The growth has been driven by several factors, including an ageing population, a growing middle class, the rising proportion of lifestyle diseases, an increased emphasis on public-private partnerships as well as accelerated adoption of digital technologies, including telemedicine, besides heightened interest from investors, the paper noted.\n\n     \n      In the first five months of 2024, private equity and venture capital investments in the Indian healthcare sector surpassed $ 1 billion, a 220% increase from the previous year, according to the Indian Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF).\n\nBetting on local for globalPharmaceutical companies make up a large chunk of the company\u2019s portfolio. In its second fund, pharmaceuticals make up 50% of the fund, healthcare services make up for 30%, and the remaining 20% is for healthtech and medtech, Chandramouli said. One of the key areas of focus for the fund within pharma is companies catering to the regulated markets.\n\n     \n      Of the existing four pharma companies in its portfolio, two are India-focused \u2013 Noble Plus Pharmacy and Skin Care and Linux Laboratories, which focuses on domestic formulations \u2013 while two are focused on global markets. This includes Sakar Healthcare, which is focused on branded exports and contract manufacturing, and complex generics maker Orbicular Pharmaceutical Technologies.\n\n     \n      TCHF invested up to $20 million in Orbicular in May 2024. Orbicular is a contract development and manufacturing company, which focuses on complex generics formulations for the regulated markets like the US.\n\n     \n      Complex and specialty generics is a key focus for the industry, and Chandramouli anticipates secular growth for the segment over the next decade, \u201cgiven the fact that a whole host of patents are expiring in the complex generics space,\" she said. \u201cEspecially in the ones for the GLP (Glucagon-like Peptide) analogue space, that\u2019s one of the complex generics that Orbicular is targeting, which is for both diabetes as well as weight loss products,\" she added.\n\n     \n      Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) drugs are used to treat type-2 diabetes and obesity. The patent for semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor antagonist, is set to expire in several countries in 2026. Semaglutide is patented by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, which sells it under brand names Ozempic and Wegovy and has seen phenomenal demand. The GLP-1 market is expected to exceed $100 billion by 2030, according to JP Morgan.\n\nAlso Read: Why Tata Capital Healthcare Fund is wary of healthtech betsIndian pharma majors like Dr. Reddy's, Cipla, Zydus, Lupin and Sun Pharma are gearing up to launch generic versions of GLP-1 drugs as patents expire to cash in on the burgeoning market.\n\n     \n      The fund will continue to focus on companies that have the potential to scale up and target regulated markets, she said.\n\nSlow on healthtechMint reported earlier this year that TCHF was wary of healthtech bets. The fund has one healthtech investment in its portfolio \u2013 when it poured $10 million in Deeptek Inc, an artificial intelligence-backed radiology imaging business, in 2022.\n\n     \n      \u201cHealthtech, by nature of the business itself, it's not something which, at least at an investment level, will be an Ebitda positive,\" Chandramouli said. \u201cIf you look at our fund two, nine of our 10 investments are mid-sized revenue companies with a strong growth as well as with solid Ebitda margins. Even our healthtech portfolio has a very strong growth, but it's the only one which is not yet Ebitda positive,\" she added. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, and is a key measure of a company's profitability.\n\nAlso Read: Tata Capital\u2019s healthcare arm invests $10 million in Apex Kidney CareChandramouli reiterated that they hadn\u2019t changed their stance, especially for online pharmacies, which is the biggest segment within healthtech. \u201cIt's still a model which is yet to evolve in a very sustainable way,\" she said. \u201cOne is watching how some of the large players are going to scale up, how they are going to move towards profitability\u2026So they are all in a wait-and-watch mode,\" she said.

It was the billionaires' league where people like David Tepper, owner of the Carolina Panthers, and Steve Cohen, owner of the New York Mets, would stake their claims. But a few major milestones over the past decade have paved the way for more relaxed rules around sports-team ownership, a shift that has opened the industry to investors of all levels. Formula 1 kicked off the trend in 2006 after allowing private equity firm CVC Capital Partners to purchase it. Then, in 2021, the NBA allowed private equity to own up to 20% of franchises. Now, investors can gain exposure in two main ways: through equity, where they can snag minority ownership of teams or franchises and bag some gains on the upside, or through credit, by providing loans or structured equity to help develop a team or stadium. The attractiveness of sports investing has been a byproduct of the sector's outsize growth relative to the broad equity market, says Jay Serpe, the global head of strategy and business development for alternatives at JPMorgan Private Bank. The investment bank's 2025 outlook report showed that the total value of mergers and acquisitions within sports increased by more than eight times over the past five years as opposed to those within public equities, which has declined by 40%. The sector has seen tremendous growth with rapidly expanding valuations, which is expected to continue, and that's attracting private capital, says Ted Yarbrough, the CIO at Yieldstreet, a firm that brings alternatives, including sports, to accredited retail investors. Below is a chart from Yieldstreet that shows how sports leagues have performed over the last 10 years relative to the S&P 500. For example, the value of Major League Soccer (MLS) was up by 1,565%, or almost five times the index. \"it's reasonable to expect that returns in the sports space might have a lower correlation to other risk assets like equities,\" Serpe said. \"It'll just have unique driving forces, mostly tied to viewership and live viewership numbers that will drive a lot of the value that, in time, could prove to be a decent diversifier in portfolios away from traditional equity risk.\" The so-called asset class is an established industry with few prospects of new entrants or formations of sports franchises, making it scarce. It also has a solid future outlook. As media and, specifically, TV networks face declines in viewership, sports events continue to attract large audiences, according to JPMorgan's report. In an era of endless content, sports events remain among the rare draws audiences demand to view live, which creates a unique opportunity to capitalize on media rights, Serpe added. \"The largest area of equity exposure we've seen so far has been in the ownership of actual leagues or teams, especially the major ones,\" Serpe said. \"You've seen many large private equity firms participating in that space over the past five years or longer, and that certainly has seen significant valuation growth. Other areas are still emerging, so they could offer the potential to generate higher equity returns.\" But betting on the sports teams isn't the only way in. There are numerous routes into the industry, including media rights, ticketing, streaming, events, college athletics, and stadium development. Below is a table from JPMorgan's 2025 outlook report showing private equity funds planned investment themes. On the equity side, the value of sports franchises is often driven by media rights. But outside that, there has been significant interest in investing in other areas like women's sports or emerging sports leagues, Serpe noted. On the credit side, proving debt for real estate tied to sports, such as stadiums, has been a popular strategy because there's an asset backing the debt, he added. Like traditional investing, the more diversification, the better. For Serpe, this means gaining exposure across sports, media, and entertainment to capture potential upside and then mitigating that risk with debt or equity in more established leagues. That said, private markets have additional illiquidity risk. Therefore, investors should be compensated with higher returns at 3% to 5% annually above public markets, Serpe noted. Additionally, while there has been a tremendous amount of growth, there aren't decades of historical performance to go off of, Yarbrough said. So investors must know the projections and what's underlying them, including the cause and effect that would lead an investment thesis to be realized.

She's an award-winning customer experience expert, international keynote speaker and founder of Experience Investigators, a firm helping companies increase sales and customer attention through elevated customer experiences. She's a charter member of the Customer Experience Professionals Association and having worked with numerous Fortune 500 companies, including Orange Theory Fitness, SAP, Comcast, and JP Morgan Chase, just to name a few, we're going to talk about customer experience. So Jeannie, welcome to the show. Jeannie Walters (01:44): Thank you so much, John. I'm thrilled to be here. John Jantsch (01:47): So I start a lot of my shows asking if people to fine terms, and I find that there's a lot of terms out there that we use every day that maybe people, they have a misunderstanding or I think, well, at least I like to get your baseline. So when somebody says customer experience, how do you define that? Jeannie Walters (02:06): Well, I'm so glad you asked because it is a term that gets thrown around a lot and often when I introduce myself and I say something about customer experience, people immediately make the mental jump to customer service. John Jantsch (02:18): And Jeannie Walters (02:18): They love to tell me their worst customer service story as a customer. And customer service is part of the experience, but the way that we define customer experience is it is literally what happens throughout the entire journey. Every interaction you have between a brand and a customer from before they even know they need you to all the way to when they leave you or become a lifelong customer. And I also like to remind people that your customers are having an experience whether you talk about it or not. And so what we try to really help our clients with and what I've been dedicated to for all this time is really helping get more proactive and intentional about designing the customer experience so that you can really relate to what customers actually need in that moment and then give them that so that they keep going through the journey with you. John Jantsch (03:16): As I listened to you, describe that there would be some, myself included that would argue that sounds like marketing. I knew this was coming. So where is customer experience a subset of marketing? Does it walk alongside marketing? How do you fit that in? Jeannie Walters (03:34): So I look at it as two different lenses that compliment each other. So marketing is really an act inside the business to help connect with customers and help actually kind of guide them to where we think they should go next. That's what we're trying to do. Customer experience is more about understanding from the customer's perspective, what is it they need when so that we can actually design that inside the organization. A lot of the work we do in customer experience is helping really us as business leaders understand how to even understand the customer journey because we are taught to think about our role and our org chart and all of those things. Customer doesn't care. John Jantsch (04:21): Plus, I think a lot of it goes on today without our knowledge, right? Jeannie Walters (04:24): Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. We have so much less control than we did John Jantsch (04:29): 10, Jeannie Walters (04:30): 15 years ago for sure. John Jantsch (04:34): A lot of times when people think customer experience, they'll say like, oh, we need to wow our customers, which that could be good, but how do you first align? I know with marketing plans and marketing strategy, we always try to align them with business goals. I assume that there's a role for that alignment when you talk customer experience isn't there. Jeannie Walters (04:53): Yes, absolutely. And this is one of the, I think persistent myths out there is that as customer experience leaders, we need to care about our customer satisfaction rate or our net promoter score or things like that, which absolutely, but those are measurements, they're indicators, they aren't outcomes. So what I like to do is look at what are the organizational goals? What are we trying to do here, and what are the levers we need to pull within the customer experience to help us both understand how to get there and also look for opportunities and challenges and ways that we can just make things a little easier for our customers? A little less friction. I personally don't believe we have to wow every customer every time because that's not realistic either. John Jantsch (05:43): It's exhausting. Jeannie Walters (05:44): Yeah, it's exhausting. And some of those things that are held up as those wow moments, they're not scalable. They're things that are pr, they're great PR and marketing, but they're not necessarily scalable. So what we to look at is really understanding what does your customer need in this moment and how do we know? Because sometimes humans say one thing and they behave differently. So you can have all the surveys in the world and you could still get it wrong. So you really need to be savvy about understanding customer behavior, operational metrics, the indicators that are out there to help us get the business outcomes that we're aiming to get. John Jantsch (06:22): Yeah. What was that Henry Ford saying? If I'd asked my customers what they wanted, they would've set a faster horse. Jeannie Walters (06:28): That's right. That's right. That's right. And innovation is a huge part of this, and it's a huge opportunity, but that means that you can't just ask because humans don't make any sense. John Jantsch (06:43): Well, and a lot of the greatest innovations out there, the iPod for example, I mean, nobody was even thinking about that as something that they needed, right? Jeannie Walters (06:55): Right, exactly. Exactly. John Jantsch (06:56): So what role do you see increasing role? There's definitely a role, huge role for good or bad technology playing in customer experience. I mean, you have technology that I think at one point sometimes people look at it as, oh good, we'll never have to talk to those damn customers again because we've got this technology that'll do it. And then there's also places where it's like, no, the example I always love to use is when I go see my eye doctor, I don't want to have to call somebody. I want to go on there, schedule my appointment, and they've got my record there. To me, that was a better customer experience, but when I'm getting examined, I want somebody who's very listening and different experience. So how do you help people navigate technology? Jeannie Walters (07:42): Yeah, it's a great question because I mean, one thing to keep in mind is technology is a tool on the toolkit. You still have to figure out what is the overall strategic vision that you have, what are you trying to do, who are you serving? All of those things. But what I really am seeing that I get excited about is actually exactly your example. We want more self-service options. As customers, we want to be able to have choice based on context. Sometimes I hear people categorize people like, well, the big one before the pandemic, the big one was, well, anybody 50 plus, they're not a digital customer, right? Well, and of course that is not true. It's all about context. There are times where you don't want to call. There are times where you need to call and we need to give customers options. And technology gives us so many great ways to, again, proactively think about this and design those touch points. So if somebody gets stuck with that technology, do they have an option where they can call somebody who knows that they've already been through that? Because the most frustrating thing that can happen is you spend your life telling a chatbot your life story, and then they can't help you and you pick up the phone and call and they didn't know that happened. They have no visibility. (09:02): And that's the technology I'm seeing that I think will vastly improve the customer experience, is connecting the dots inside the organization and giving the right people the right visibility so that when you call and you're already angry and you're frustrated because you just went through that chatbot thing, somebody who is answering that call understands that's where you are in your journey and can respond immediately and say, I have all your information. I know exactly what to do next, and I'm sorry that happened. So I think we have to blend the ease and efficiency of technology with the understanding and empathy of humans on a regular basis, and look for ways that we can basically jump in at either point and give customers the options that they are asking for. John Jantsch (09:48): AI might be the most important new computer technology ever. It's storming every industry and literally billions of dollars are being invested. Buckle up. The problem is that AI needs a lot of speed and processing power. So how do you compete without cost spiraling out of control? It's time to upgrade to the next generation of the cloud. Oracle Cloud infrastructure or O-C-I-O-C-I is a single platform for your infrastructure, database, application development, and AI needs. OCI has four to eight times the bandwidth of other clouds offers one consistent price instead of a variable regional pricing. And of course, nobody does data better than Oracle. So now you can train your AI models at twice the speed and less than half of the cost of other clouds. If you want to do more and spend less like Uber eight by eight and Databricks Mosaic, take a free test [email\u00a0protected] slash duct tape. (10:46): That's oracle.com\/duct tape oracle.com\/duct tape. You bring up a good point though, the cliche of the generational thing that you used there, but there are realities in some generational differences into how people want to be treated, or at least what their expectations are. I always kind of tease my kids if I can be cliche, I'm just a lot more patient than they are. If something doesn't work the way it's supposed to work, they're out of there. And I'm like, okay, let's try another path. Do companies need to try to understand that? Is it possible to understand the generational differences? Jeannie Walters (11:25): Absolutely. And I think a big one that I'm seeing is that the way we behave as customers is very different. And part of that is, I mean, there used to be an expression that if your mom used tide detergent, you used it, right? There was just no question. And now the younger generations are much more likely to, number one, align their values with who they do business with, and they're very serious about this. There have been other generations who about it, but aren't necessarily acting on it. These younger generations are acting on that. So you need to make sure you're visible and transparent with your values in a different way in order to attract the right customers. The other part of that is to your point, there's some irony in some of the behavioral assumptions we make because some of the younger generations are actually more savvy about when to call. (12:20): So they reach a certain point and they know the only way I'm going to get this solved is by calling, but they're prepared for it. They're not, not frazzled, they're just solving their problem in a different way. So we have to again, figure out what's the best way to serve them in that moment within this context, because I really believe that all of us as humans, I mean the world is changing at such an incredible speed, and we have to learn new things every single day. We can't just do what we did last week, and we have to keep up with that for customers. But it's all about the context of the need and where they are in their journey, and also who they are. There are some people who they want quick answers, they don't want a lot of empathy. They just want you to tell 'em what's wrong and move on. There are other people who, they want the whole thing. They want to tell you everything that happened. And so we need to figure out how do we recognize those people and serve them in the best possible way in that moment. And some of that is generational, and a lot of that is contextual now. John Jantsch (13:24): So I'm going to come back to that point, but you mentioned speed, and I would say speed has become a huge driver today of customer experience or at least expectation. I was watching a movie the other day and these kind of teenage kids, their mom had died a few years ago and they found a camera of hers and they had film in it. And so they took it to a place and the guy said, do you want the one hour service? And they were like, it's going to take an hour. Jeannie Walters (13:51): That's a great example. John Jantsch (13:52): It really is. And I do think so how are you factoring in the idea that speed is just become an Jeannie Walters (13:59): Expectation? Well, I think in a way it's always been an expectation, but we've learned as customers kind of how to be complacent about it. And so one of the things that I always look for is what are the assumptions we're making about time? And what I mean by that is, for instance, one of the things I love to ask in these workshops we do is, okay, what do you do really well here? And a lot of people say, well, we get back to people we're really friendly. And I'll say, okay, so what's your definition of soon? And you get 18 different answers. Because if you don't define what we mean by those time indications, we are going to set the wrong expectations for customers. And that's where disappointment comes in. So some of this is about setting the right expectations and being proactive when we don't know something, when we have to call back and say, Hey, I don't have this yet, but I will. And so I think part of what customers are expecting is the worst. You're not going to call me back when you say you're not, or what do you mean it's going to take an hour? That's a great example. That's crazy to them. And so we need to make sure that when we talk about time, we are all speaking the same language. And sometimes that's just not the case right now. John Jantsch (15:26): Yeah, because so much of success in life, let alone in business, is just meeting expectations, right? Absolutely. If you thought it was coming Friday and it came Thursday, you're a hero. But if it came Saturday, it was like, no, the whole thing failed. So how much of this in an organization, when I heard you describing people making decisions about, oh, this person's already angry, so I need to handle it this way. How much of that is taught? How much of that is just culture? Jeannie Walters (15:57): Oh, that's a great question, John. I think, I mean, it's definitely a combination of both because we can teach and train to so many different scenarios, and somebody will show up with a totally different one the next day because humans have all sorts of crazy stuff happen. So we have to both develop a culture where people feel empowered by a similar value structure. And what I mean by that is we use something called a customer experience mission statement. And the reason we started developing this is because we saw that a lot of people said things like, well, we want to deliver exceptional customer experiences, but you and I might handle those things differently based on our life experience and our judgment and all of that. And neither one is wrong, it's just different. But if you are inconsistent, that actually chips away at the trust with the customer. (16:50): So we want to make sure that we are really aligned around a culture that empowers people to make the right decisions in the right moment. Having said that, we need to spend some time on teaching and training and alignment, because otherwise we are just asking everybody. I mean, one of my favorite examples of this is I was looking at the goals of an organization, and one of their big goals was we need to deliver friendlier experiences for our customers. And I said, well, how do you know if you're succeeding at that? And so we have to spend some time figuring out what are we really saying? What are the stakes in the ground? What are the milestones? How do we know if we're successful? Because then you can bring that back to the culture and say, this is what we really mean. This is who we are no matter what, and this is how we show up for our customers and for one another. And that alignment is really important too. We can't treat customers one way and treat each other a different way. John Jantsch (17:49): And that's really to the culture point. You're absolutely right. I mean, a lot of times, I used to say years ago that any way, shape and form in which your business is coming into contact with a customer or prospect, that contact is performing a marketing function. And a lot of times as organizations grow, the leadership has no contact with the customer anymore. Jeannie Walters (18:10): Yeah, it's very true. John Jantsch (18:11): And yet those people are probably treating the customers about as well as you're treating them, right? Jeannie Walters (18:20): Yep. Yep. That is definitely something that as people get further up in the org chart, they get further and further away. And to your point, the opposite is true where all of the behavior rolls down the org chart too. And so it is really important that people feel, again, that alignment with values that's just so important in any culture. John Jantsch (18:41): Yeah. I know in our organization over the years, I've had people that customer, they have a bad experience with a customer, and they're kind of bad mouthing the customer in front of the team. I'm like, we just can't do that ever, ever, because it's not acceptable for them to do. And if we're saying that's the behavior, but especially in smaller organizations, that takes intention, doesn't it Jeannie Walters (19:05): Does for sure. John Jantsch (19:06): Tell me a little bit. So if I came to you and I said, Hey, this customer experience thing sounds awesome, you need to customer experience us. How would that start? I mean, are we going to map out journey points or touch points? I mean, what's the process look like? Jeannie Walters (19:21): Yep. I always think of customer experience work and really setting the foundation for it in any organization as a three step kind of foundational process. And then we move into, we've got all these tools in our toolkit, like customer journey mapping, but I like to start with the idea that it's a mindset, it's a strategy, and then it's a discipline within your organization. So you kind of have to think about it. Any other part of your business, you would never say, for instance, we should really do sales, so let's bring in somebody, do a workshop. And if that doesn't work, I guess sales doesn't work. That would never happen. But we do that a lot with customer experience. We think it's a magic wand. So we like to think about it as to get the mindset you need that customer experience, mission statement, something centralized within your organization. (20:09): So we do workshops and strategy and executive coaching on that, and then we go into strategy, which is really what are you trying to do and what are the efforts that we're going to put into this to achieve those outcomes? So we define those outcomes and all of those things. That's with something we call a strategy success statement. And then we move into the discipline of it. How are we going to get this done? Who's involved? How do we actually work together? How do we get our leaders involved and how do we know if we're successful? And all of those things. So that's kind of the foundation of it. And then there are things like, yeah, we want to map out what is the ideal experience. I really believe that innovation is experience driven right now. You think about the disruptors of the last 20 years, they've all been experience driven. And so we do something called experiential innovation where we help people think about how do they disrupt their industry with experience. So there are all these different ways, and it's all based on what are you trying to do as an organization and how can we help you be the most successful you can be, while at the same time making it a win. So your customers, your employees, and all your stakeholders love you. That's really what we're trying to do, John Jantsch (21:19): How important. We're going to run out of time here. So I'll wrap up pretty quickly. I'd love to know, so I've got this roadmap. We've identified things, processes, campaigns, whatever that need to be put in place. How important is testing and monitoring and analyzing, this worked, this didn't work. Let's try something. I mean, I'm sure a lot of people are senate, forget it people, right? It's like, this is our process. Here's our SOP go. Jeannie Walters (21:43): Yep. Yeah. It is important, and I like to think about it less about testing and more about pilots, because a lot of times you want to test things in a way that you'll know yes or no, and humans just are very unpredictable. And so what I like to do is take a smaller kind of subset and say, okay, let's learn from this pilot, because we always get feedback. We always learn something in that. Then you can start applying at scale and see what works and what doesn't. So we do that as well as inviting customers into the process, making sure that if you're doing customer journey mapping and you never talk to a customer, you are missing a huge opportunity as well as your frontline workers, your cashiers, your customer service reps, your salespeople. Sometimes they're left out of the process mapping, and I'm like, no, we need them. So we think about it as customer collaboration. You need to have that along the way every step of the way, John Jantsch (22:44): And even customer or units inside of an organization. I can't tell you how many times I've talked to a leader of marketing and sales and customer service, and they're like, wait, after we get an order, you do that. Jeannie Walters (22:55): Absolutely. That happens. Absolutely. Yep. John Jantsch (22:57): So it's pretty incredible. It's like, oh, nobody bothered to talk to each other. Jeannie Walters (23:01): Great. That's right. That's right. And that's what I love about things like journey mapping and service blueprinting, because you get people together and just the act of that can create real change in an organization. John Jantsch (23:13): Yeah. Well, Jeanie, I appreciate you taking a few moments to stop by the Duct Tape Marketing Podcast. Is there some place you'd invite people to connect you and learn about your work? Jeannie Walters (23:20): Sure. Yes, please join [email\u00a0protected].

The Dow Jones Industrial Average logged a record close on Monday, as U.S. Treasury bonds saw their biggest rally in nearly four months after President-elect Donald Trump selected Scott Bessent as his nominee for Treasury secretary. President-elect Donald Trump is threatening to impose sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office as part of his efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs. The tariffs, if implemented, could dramatically raise prices on everything from gas to automobiles. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday that on his first day in office he will impose a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. The announcement sparked a dollar rally. It rose 1% against the Canadian dollar and 2% against the Mexican peso, while share markets in Asia fell, as did European equity futures ratcheting up concerns about his America First policies. Crude oil prices on Monday settled sharply lower on the back of speculation over a cease-fire in Lebanon, combined with what appears to be restraint on the part of Iran. U.S. President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron are expected to announce a ceasefire in Lebanon between armed group Hezbollah and Israel imminently, four senior Lebanese sources said on Monday. Asian shares were mostly lower on Tuesday on the back of Trump\u2019s threat to impose tariffs on China, which could have an impact on other Asian economies. Nifty rose again on Nov 25 adding nearly 4% in two consecutive sessions of gains to regain its losses on a month-on-month basis. At close, Nifty was up 1.32% or 314.7 points at 24221.9. A small negative candle was formed on the daily chart with upper and lower shadow. Technically, this pattern indicates an upside breakout for the Nifty with an unfilled opening upside gap. If this gap remains unfilled for the next few sessions, it may mean formation of an important bottom reversal for Nifty around 23263 levels. In the near term 24500 could still pose some resistance for the Nifty while 23900 could offer support.

Singapore-based Partior, which uses blockchain for real-time clearing and settlement, said on Nov 27 that Deutsche Bank has joined its Series B funding round as a strategic investor.  The fresh capital injection will be used to strengthen Partior\u2019s global reach, scale its cross-border capability, as well as develop and enhance innovative functions like intraday foreign exchange swaps, among other things.\u00a0 Deutsche Bank will join Partior\u2019s platform as a euro and US dollar settlement bank.  The move complements the German bank\u2019s recent launch of dbX, which is a next-generation correspondent banking ecosystem.  Partior\u2019s announcement marks the close of the second round in the firm\u2019s Series B funding.  The first round of Series B funding, which closed in mid-July, was led by venture capital firm Peak XV Partners, formerly known as Sequoia Capital India and South-east Asia.  Temasek, Standard Chartered, JP Morgan, trading company Jump Trading Group and investment firm Valor Capital Group had also participated in the July round.  Mr Humphrey Valenbreder, chief executive of Partior, said the new support will help the firm to step up its vision to deliver seamless, secure and instant cross-border transactions for financial institutions worldwide.  \u201cWe are also proud to announce that we have now processed over US$1 billion in value worth of transactions, marking a significant mile\u00adstone in our journey and the growing industry belief in our platform,\u201d he added.  Ms Patricia Sullivan, Deutsche\u2019s global head for institutional cash management, said the payments business is now undergoing an exten\u00adsive period of disruption, large\u00adly due to the rapid advancement of technology and demand for greater financial inclusion and transparency.  Partior was set up in 2021 by DBS Bank, JP Morgan and Temasek through the Monetary Authority of Singapore\u2019s Project Ubin initiative, which explored the use of blockchain.  The firm simplifies the clearing and settlement process for global financial market participants, including banks and payment service providers. Its blockchain-based network removes the need for intermediaries and addresses longstanding industry inefficiencies in transactions, including settlement delays, limited transparency and high operating costs.

Working with a Chinese company would instead be \u201csimple and straightforward.\u201d Apple had reportedly been exploring using its own generative AI models in China, but a top regulator has strongly implied that this wouldn\u2019t be in the Cupertino company\u2019s best interests \u2026  Any company wanting to launch a generative AI product in China needs approval from a regulator. The Financial Times reports that the regulator in question has just given a pretty clear indication on what the government expects. Apple is facing an uphill battle to release its own artificial intelligence models for iPhones and other products in China, with a top Beijing official warning that foreign companies will confront a \u201cdifficult and long process\u201d to win approval unless they partner with local groups [\u2026] The high-ranking official at the Cyberspace Administration of China said it would be a comparatively \u201csimple and straightforward approval process\u201d for foreign device makers to use already vetted LLMs (large language model, aka generative AI) from Chinese groups. Two sources cited by the FT said that Apple has been considering using its own LLMs in China, but has also been in talks with Chinese tech companies. The Chinese government exerts a tight stranglehold on sources of online information within the country. Google pulled out of the country after it was forced to censor search results, and many other western platforms are blocked by the Great Firewall of China, including Facebook, X, and Wikipedia. Many search terms are also blocked when using the locally-owned Baidu search engine. AI products of course provide another means of effectively carrying out web searches, and it\u2019s clear the government wants to be able to control these too, hence effectively forcing foreign companies to use approved Chinese-owned models. Apple has already seen iPhone sales in China plummet after the government banned their use by officials, and suggested it was unpatriotic for its citizens to buy a phone from a foreign-owned company. A JP Morgan analyst said that Apple would probably take a \u201cflexible\u201d approach in order to get approval, but even so the Apple Intelligence launch in China would likely be pushed into the second half of 2025. The FT said that Apple declined to comment on the report. While it would be nice to imagine Apple would resist this pressure, the reality is that it will inevitably acquiesce. China is simply too important to the company, not just because it accounts for 17% of Apple\u2019s global sales, but because it remains the Cupertino company\u2019s most important manufacturing center. As CEO Tim Cook said only yesterday: \u201cWe could not do what we do without them [Chinese suppliers].\u201d In many cases, Apple has been forced to do unsavoury things like remove VPN apps and US news apps from the App Store in order to comply with the law. In this case, it could in theory simply decide not to launch Apple Intelligence in China, but the commercial and political risks are likely too high to make this feasible. 9to5Mac collage of images from Apple and Sean Sinclair\u00a0on\u00a0Unsplash FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

To stop it, food industry lobbyists attempted every tactic imaginable, eventually taking over the Department of Agriculture and in time forcing the dedicated public servant leading it (Harvey Wiley) to quit. Because of this, many toxic food additives Wiley fought against gained \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) status and remain in use today. \u2022The handicapping of the FDA came to a head in 1962, when thalidomide was just barely prevented from devastating America\u2019s children, prompting Congress to give the FDA much broader powers to police the safety and efficacy of drugs. \u2022Unfortunately, this law backfired, as the FDA created an impossible to reach standard of efficacy that it selectively enforced to protect the pharmaceutical industry and simultaneously began utilizing increasingly brazen (and illegal) police tactics against anyone promoting effective natural therapies. \u2022Because of this, many life-changing medical therapies (discussed throughout this article) were blacklisted by the FDA and faded into obscurity. This, along with the FDA\u2019s tendency to push unsafe and ineffective therapies (e.g., vaccines or antidepressants) onto the market regardless of how much data argued against doing so, led to the FDA becoming the most protested agency in the federal government. \u2022Nonetheless, every attempt to fix the FDA failed. In this article, I will review the structural issues that have perpetually caused the FDA to succumb to incompetence and corruption. I propose potential solutions that can utilize the unprecedented window created by the Make America Healthy Again movement to end the FDA\u2019s war against America\u2019s health. For most of my life, I have observed the FDA belligerently suppress natural treatments and any unorthodox therapy which threatens the medical monopoly while simultaneously railroading through a variety of unsafe and ineffective drugs regardless of how much public protest the agency meets. Consider for example, this 2004 Senate testimony by the FDA scientist who got Vioxx banned that accurately described exactly what would come to pass with the COVID vaccines two decades later: As such, I do not hold the FDA in a positive light, especially given that during COVID-19, I (like many others) spent hundreds of hours trying to get the agency to allow the limited use of off-patent therapeutics for COVID-19\u2014all of which ultimately went nowhere due to the unjustifiable roadblocks the agency kept putting up.Note: given my familiarity with the FDA\u2019s conduct, I felt the odds were against those endeavors succeeding, but I nonetheless exhausted myself supporting effective alternative therapies because I didn\u2019t want to live with the knowledge I could have done something that could have prevented the unfolding tragedy but chose not to. Over the last year, and especially since Trump won the election, I have received a lot of inquiries as to how the FDA could be reformed over the next four years. Given the importance of presenting the issue correctly, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time trying to look at both sides of the question. In medicine, \u201csensitivity\u201d denotes how likely a test is not to miss something that\u2019s there, while \u201cspecificity\u201d denotes how likely a test is not to have a false positive. The great challenge with these two concepts is that there\u2019s almost always a trade-off. Hence, as you increase one, the other reciprocally declines (e.g., as the PCR cycle threshold was increased on COVID tests, while it was harder to miss an infection, you also became more and more likely to get false positives from the tests\u2014which is frequently what happened). In turn, many issues in medicine result from a poor balance between the two (e.g., Peter C. G\u00f8tzsche made a good case that the sensitivity for routine breast cancer screening is too high, which leads to many women being erroneously diagnosed with dangerous breast cancers and subject to unnecessary treatments). This same trade-off also exists throughout politics as there are often two conflicting positions (e.g., wanting a robust death penalty to serve as a deterrent against violent crimes but also not wanting to execute innocent individuals), and in many cases the eventual position that\u2019s settled on is the result of a prolonged battle that eventually reaches a midpoint between sensitivity and specificity that while not ideal, is begrudgingly acceptable to both sides. In my eyes, the most important thing to understand about this dynamic is that it typically takes an incredible amount of work to reach the functional compromise that\u2019s eventually settled upon, so if the existing process is scrapped (e.g. because people who are polarized on the issue can only see it from their side\u2019s perspective) what follows (e.g., a complete lack of police enforcement in high crime areas) is often much worse than what preceded it. In the case of the FDA, the agency\u2019s situation has run into a similar issue\u2014the FDA is expected to keep bad foods and drugs off the market while not blocking good ones from getting to the public. While this seems \u201csimple,\u201d it\u2019s actually an incredibly challenging task, and the agency's history is one of it frequently abysmally failing at both\u2014even when its leadership was composed of dedicated public servants who put the wellbeing of the American people before everything else.

In the late 1800s, food producers would constantly sell adulterated food, while early pharmaceutical companies would sell a variety of proprietary medicines with secret ingredients that were inevitably things like opium and alcohol. Gradually, public outrage built around this, particularly since journalists and newspapers were willing to expose the issue (e.g., Upton Sinclair\u2019s 1904 book The Jungle played a pivotal role in awakening the public to the immense problems with the meat industry).Eventually, in 1906, the Pure Food and Drug Act was passed, which gave the Bureau of Chemistry the authority to ensure products sold in America were accurately labeled (e.g., no hidden opium or counterfeit foods), and that the food was not adulterated. While the publicly strongly supported this law (e.g., the public did not want to eat potentially dangerous food additives), the industry resisted and relentlessly fought Congress not to pass the law, using many of the same lines and ploys we would see today (e.g., industry lobbies would always appear to shut down any attempts to legislate against this). Eventually, it passed with the compromise that the courts would be the means to challenge enforcement actions by the law. The director of the Bureau of Chemistry (and thus the first head of the FDA), Harvey Wiley, felt very strongly about the dangers of chemical additives being put into our foods and in 1905, began a series of tests where he gave young healthy government volunteers (e.g., those most resistant to chronic poisoning) higher doses of the additives commonly being used in foods and was able to demonstrate the recipients gradually became ill. Now, I want to say this, because I regard it as important. For fifteen or twenty days, or even longer in some cases, no visible effects were produced in what you would call \"symptoms.\" The young men had normal appetites and performed their work without any discomfort, and had no complaints. After that time they began to eat their ration with some little discomfort. They were under obligation to do it, but they often said: \"I wish you could let this go ; I don't want it.\" Their appetites began to fail. At the end every one of their appetites was very badly affected, and some of them were unable any longer to eat the full amount. Of course we never required anything that was impossible. They developed persistent headaches in most cases, followed by general depression and debility. It was extremely well marked in every instance. It had a worse effect in the food when they knew it was in the food, because it became repugnant to them.  Unfortunately the effects in some cases were very much prolonged. Some of the young men\u2014the experiments ended in July, or in June, the end of the year\u2014and some of the young men complained even through the summer, and it was late in the autumn before they recovered their full normal appetites. Note: the additives Wiley tested were boric acid and borax, salicylic acid (aspirin) and salicylates, benzoic acid and benzoates, sulfur dioxide and sulfites, formaldehyde, sulfate of copper (used to green produce), and saltpeter (nitrates). In turn, a schism gradually developed in the scientific community, where Wiley (and many other respected doctors and physiologists) argued evidence showed those additives were dangerous. At the same time, a variety of scientists (who were paid off by the food industry) misleadingly testified to both Congress and then later the courts that the additives were \u201csafe\u201d or necessary (e.g., to prevent microbial food poisoning). He came up and introduced himself to me [Wiley] and attempted to make some apology for his part in the activities of the Remsen Board [which was created to sabotage the FDA]. He realized very keenly the condition they were in, in espousing the cause of adulteration, becoming the paid agents of the adulterators, and incurring the universal condemnation of the press and the people of the country. Dr. Herter was then a very sick man. In a few months from that date he died. Initially, the honest scientists (fully backed by the public) won, and Congress gave the Bureau of Chemistry the full authority to clean up the food. Still, the industry was relentless, and after failing in the courts (even in friendly jurisdictions), decided to target the executive branch directly, and successfully convinced the Secretary of Agriculture to sabotage Wiley\u2019s work. At first, President Theodore Roosevelt vigorously opposed these efforts, and protected Wiley, but eventually he sided with the industry, and created a board (not authorized by the 1906 Food and Drug Act), which overrode everything Wiley tried to do. Roosevelt\u2019s about-face in turn, occurred for four key reasons. \u2022The food law that was passed was different from what Roosevelt had initially wanted (he wanted it to focus on meat, but the eventual meat provision that was added at the very end differed was considerably altered).\u2022He experienced an increasing number of complaints that the Food and Drug Act was costing industry and trading partners money.\u2022The Secretary of Agriculture forced Wiley to testify against Roosevelt\u2019s position on importation taxes for Cuban sugar in front of Congress (which greatly offended Roosevelt). \u2022When Roosevelt was alerted to the fact Wiley wanted to remove saccharin from the marketplace (Roosevelt\u2019s favorite sweetener), this exchange took place (which due to its consequences, tormented Wiley for decades): This answer was the basis for the complete paralysis of the Food Law. Turning to me in sudden anger the President changed from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde, and said: \"You tell me that saccharin is injurious to health?\" I said, \"Yes, Mr. President, I do tell you that.\" He replied, \"Dr. Rixey gives it to me every day.\" I answered, \"Mr. President, he probably thinks you may be threatened with diabetes.\" To this he retorted, \"Anybody who says saccharin is injurious to health is an idiot\" Note: I share this passage to illustrate how things that go catastrophically awry can often result from one unfortunate domino rippling out over decades. In turn, while courts, state governments, legislatures, and most importantly the public supported what Wiley wanted to do, key parts of the executive branch did not. As such, his agency\u2019s enforcement ability continually declined (e.g., virtually no enforcement actions were allowed to be brought against the thousands of cases of food adulteration they encountered), his inconvenient scientific research (e.g., on the dangers of arsenic, food colorings and preservatives in foods) was blocked from publication, partially successful attempts were made to frame him and evict him from his post (along with other types of retaliation occurring against other government employees who tried to fight for clean food), and once Taft became president in 1909, it became even more challenging for Wiley to enforce the laws (e.g., Taft overturned the ban on selling fake whiskey). Note: in parallel to this, the Department of Agriculture created a \u201cBureau of Soil,\u201d which usurped the Bureau of Chemistry\u2019s responsibility for analyzing soil around the country (but ultimately never got anything meaningful done). This was highly problematic as it both handicapped the Bureau of Chemistry\u2019s ability to do research, but also removed the systematic analysis of the chemistry of the nation\u2019s soils (which was\/is necessary as the trace minerals present make a considerable impact on the health of the plants and those who eat them). Likewise, another agency (the Bureau of Standards) decided it wanted to expand its influence and partnered with industry to create a variety of profitable technologies (that lay outside its Congressional mandate) while simultaneously usurping the Bureau of Chemistry\u2019s resources and responsibilities to advance its own interests. Eventually, in 1912, Wiley, one of the most respected public servants in the country, resigned because he realized he could do more to help the public as a private citizen than within the government and in 1927, the Bureau of Chemistry was turned into the FDA (at which point it lost the ability to do many of the critical functions it had provided to monitor the safety of the country). Far later, Wiley wrote the book \u201cThe History of A Crime Against The Food Law\u201d (which can be read here and details much of the same abhorrent behavior we see now happening over a hundred years ago). To quote one newspaper from the time: He [Dr. Wiley] has been practically without power to put the law into effect against strong offenders. He has been humiliated by being overruled by his subordinates. He has suffered from an inefficient administration of the Department of which his bureau is a part; for the venerable Secretary of Agriculture is too old vigorously to administer his great Department. Yet Dr. Wiley, purely for patriotic reasons, has suffered this hindrance and humiliation till some change might come which should unshackle him. On the outside the bad food and drug interests\u2014or some of them\u2014have maintained a lobby in Washington, have kept \"syndicate\" newspaper writers in their pay to write about the unfairness and the injustice of the law and the unreasonableness and \"crankiness\" of Dr. Wiley. One such organization\u2014or pretended organization\u2014some time ago sent a threatening letter to all the most important periodicals, saying that large advertisers would withdraw their patronage if they published articles favorable to the law! To illustrate how much things remain the same, a series of investigative reports have recently shown that the lobbyists from the processed food industry are now working fervently behind the scenes to block RFK\u2019s nomination and prevent him from reforming the industry as Secretary of HHS. Beyond the tactics being remarkably similar to what Wiley detailed the industry doing over a century ago, they also touch on a central point Wiley raised\u2014the only way to create change in this industry is to coax the public at large to demand it, as the moment you rely upon the members of the government to fix it, lobbyists will crush those efforts. In turn, had RFK not created the Make America Healthy Again Movement and been very strategic in how he leveraged its clout, we\u2019d never have a chance of cleaning up the food supply. Many of the additives in our foods are \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d (GRAS) and as such, very little regulation exists regarding their widespread use, regardless of their toxicity. At the time Wiley was trying to correct the nation\u2019s food supply, he faced two primary issues. The first issue was that the industry constantly made counterfeit foods to save money. For example, one of the major controversies Wiley dealt with (that Roosevelt backed him on) was people trying to make fake whiskey by taking grain alcohol (which was much cheaper to produce than whisky) and then flavoring it to taste like whiskey and labeling it as such (which Roosevelt did not approve of). Another was that oyster farmers would often float oysters in (polluted) waters to make them bulk up, a practice quite similar to how many meats now are injected with water to increase their weight, while a third was that small fish which were not sardines were being widely sold as such. The second issue was that he (and many individual states) tried to outlaw many of the more problematic additives put into our foods. Unfortunately, due to the FDA getting corrupted from the inside and the Supreme Court eventually siding with the food manufacturers, those additives were propped up despite widespread opposition to them, eventually achieving GRAS status, and since then have been widespread in our food supply. Note: those additives included sodium benzoate, sulfur dioxide, alum (potassium aluminum sulfate), sulfur dioxide, saccharin, modified corn sugars (which preceded high fructose corn syrup), saccharin, and nitrogen bleached flour\u2014many of which were linked to cancer. Sadly, since 2000, nearly 99 percent of new food chemicals added to the food supply chain have exploited the GRAS loophole. Of these additives, I personally believe the widespread use of aluminum in processed foods is likely the most detrimental (due to it greatly impairing the physiologic zeta potential and causing micro-clotting throughout the body), and provides a key explanation for why you often see certain rapid improvements in individuals once they stop eating processed foods. Wiley in turn, argued that if these additives could cause acute toxicity at higher doses, they likely caused chronic toxicity and accelerated aging at lower doses (yet remarkably paid-off scientists were able to argue that it was acceptable to give food additives at ranges just below their recognized toxic doses). Unfortunately, as the FDA became progressively more corrupt, Wiley\u2019s arguments became forgotten, and these \u201csafe\u201d additives have chronically poisoned our society.Note: a key point Wiley emphasized is that unhealthy conditions would cause organs to hypertrophy (enlarge) and lose their function\u2014which was especially consequential once the organs responsible for detoxification began to fail. One of the most remarkable things about this debacle was that the food industry would continually insist that the \u201csafe\u201d additives urgently needed to remain legal, as without them, producing their foods would no longer be possible. Yet, in case after case (e.g., sodium benzoate preserving ketchup or sulfur dioxide for preserving rotting fruit), competing companies arose that could produce the foods without the toxic additives. More importantly, they successfully argued that the primary purpose of the additives was to make it possible for an inferior quality (adulterated) product to be still sellable (e.g. by preserving something that was rotting like moldy grains or artificially coloring something that had visibly lost its nutritional value). In many cases, the companies actually switched to not using the additives because the products without them were of higher quality and, thus more popular with consumers. \u201cAre you Dr. Wiley?\u201d I said I was. He said: \"A few years ago I was the president of the Long Island Oyster Association. We regarded you as the arch-enemy of our industry when under your direction the ruling was issued that we should not add water to oysters that we shipped, nor place ice in contact with the oysters that we shipped. We considered you a devil incarnate. Now we know that decision was the salvation of our industry and I want to take your hand and congratulate you on doing the greatest service to the oyster industry that could possibly have been done. We are selling a dozen times as many oysters now in a perfect condition as they come from the water as we did at the time of your ruling.\" The Williams Brothers Company later came to believe that benzoate, or any other preservative was entirely unnecessary in such food products as ketchup, sweet pickles, preserves, etc., and then withdrew as a party to the suit [that fought to keep benzoate in use]. Not only did Williams Brothers find that a preservative such as benzoate was unnecessary, but were convinced that permission to use it allowed food manufacturers to be very careless in their methods of manufacture. In the early days of enforcement many of us thought, Dr. Wiley, that you were too radical in your ideas of pure food and felt that you were doing harm to our industry. When I look back over the changes that have come to the food industry during the past twenty-five years and see the great changes for the better that have come to our methods and our products, I wonder why we were all so blindly asleep as we were and why, much sooner than we did, we did not welcome and follow your teaching. A final point Wiley made about chronic illness and our food supply also holds just as true now as it did then: The deplorable condition of our young men was vividly shown in the Great War [World War 1]. Fully one-third of those called to the colors were found to be physically and mentally unfit to serve their country in its hour of need. Another third could only attend to camp and hospital tasks. Only one-third could go into the trenches and serve their country on the field of battle. It was a matter of supreme importance to endeavor in all honorable ways to remove the possibility of a similar stigma which might arise from any future crises of the republic. To instruct young persons to be parents, to teach them how to bring up their children after they are born, and to eliminate such a percentage of unfit are problems which require careful study. Note: RFK has repeatedly emphasized that our nation faces a grave national security risk as a recent Pentagon study found 77% of young Americans are ineligible to serve in the military due to their pre-existing health issues (e.g., obesity). In the years that followed Wiley\u2019s departure, the handicapping of the FDA continued and it drifted towards specificity (making sure it did not act in error) rather than sensitivity (taking bad things off the market) until thalidomide completely flipped things in the other direction. Discovered in 1952, thalidomide began being marketed in 1957 (initially over the counter) as a miracle cure for morning sickness, insomnia, colds, and headaches, and before long 14 pharmaceutical companies were selling it in 46 countries under at least 37 trade names. Reports soon emerged of infants born with partially missing limbs. In 1959, it was observed to cause peripheral neuritis. At the end of 1961, it was taken off the German market in November and then globally in December after an Australian doctor was finally able to get a letter published in the Lancet about it causing birth defects (after having unsuccessfully tried to sound the alarm since June of 1961).Note: during its brief availability in Germany, thalidomide was estimated to have caused over 10,000 birth defects and the deaths of approximately 2,000 children.Thalidomide\u2019s adoption in America was slower since the initial American company its manufacturer approached found it lacked efficacy in their preliminary trials and hence didn\u2019t want to market it. By the time a second company began testing it across America at the end of 1960, widespread concerns existed about thalidomide. This led the FDA reviewer assigned to thalidomide, Frances Oldham Kelsey, who was not allowed to block thalidomide from coming to market, to instead repeatedly stall its approval. As a result, roughly 20,000 American women received it during the extended clinical trials (with many injuries being observed throughout that period by the FDA). Still, it was kept away from the general population (excluding doctors who gave it to their personal circle because the manufacturer had not told them it was still experimental). Kelsey\u2019s actions in turn, resulted in only 17 American birth defects occurring (from the preliminary testing done across America) and earned her a presidential medal from John F. Kennedy on August 7, 1962. Since the FDA had lacked sufficient authority to block toxic drugs from coming to market, the near miss with thalidomide got Congress to unanimously pass the 1962 Kefauver\u2013Harris Amendment, a law that required drug manufacturers to prove their drugs were \u201csafe and effective\u201d before bringing them to market, and While this law was necessary, it also was highly misguided as it allowed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to also block a drug if: There is a lack of substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof. The term 'substantial evidence' means evidence consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations, by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved, on the basis of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded by such experts that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof.\" All of this led to a few major problems. First, Kelsey\u2019s actions dramatically increased the prestige of the FDA, both emboldening the agency and simultaneously leading to many other jealous officials wishing to get the recognition she did for stopping the next thalidomide (which DMSO, discussed later in this article, conveniently fit the profile of). Because of this, the pace of new drugs entering the market dramatically slowed, and ever since then, a consistent complaint of Congress has been the FDA blocking medical therapies the public needs.  For example, in each Congressional hearing over the FDA stonewalling DMSO, the Senators and Congressmen always emphasized the importance of a proper balance between the FDA being able to block harmful drugs while approving good drugs, but stated the pendulum had swung too far towards specificity, as since the law had passed the number of new drugs entering the market had slowed to a standstill. Secondly, it galvanized the FDA into rapidly establishing its authority and creating numerous divisions to \u201cpolice\u201d questionable drugs without the organization being structured to effectively or appropriately administer that authority (which led to perpetual mismanagement, chaos, and frequent abuse of that power).  For example, James Goddard (the FDA commissioner from 1966-1968) believed the organization required police powers to keep the scientific community in line, and used a variety of chilling tactics to enact this precedent (e.g., conducting unannounced raids and defaming researchers in the national media).  On the one hand, I can sympathize with this perspective because over the decades the FDA had lost so much of its \u201csensitivity\u201d in keeping harmful drugs off the market, but at the same time, he swung the pendulum far too far, and left the FDA with such poor specificity that it began habitually engaging in unjustified enforcement actions that significantly harmed the American people (e.g., by keeping DMSO from the country). Third, the law required efficacy to be a \u201cwell-controlled\u201d trial. This became a massive problem as the FDA relentlessly chose to define \u201cwell-controlled\u201d as a double-blind trial (to the point they clung to this specific argument in 1980 when Congress and the Senate grilled them over their decision to stonewall DMSO). This was a huge issue because: \u2022I believe it enshrined the scientific supremacy of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\u2022RCTs are extremely expensive. As such, most can only be done by the pharmaceutical industry, which due to their cost, consistently frames them (presented in favorable ways, ignoring or adjusting harmful data) to protect the company\u2019s investment (which leads to RCTs frequently being highly inaccurate). This in turn, rapidly increased the cost of drug approval, effectively turning drug approval into a pay-to-play type situation (e.g., currently, the cost to bring a new drug to market is estimated to be between 0.98-4.54 billion dollars, which makes it impossible for any unpatentable product ever to get FDA approval).\u2022RCT fundamentalism is highly misguided as smaller observational unblinded trials will typically yield the same results as large (non-corrupt) RCTs (proven by this 2014 Cochrane Review), especially if the effect of a drug is significant (rather than a tiny one that can only be detected in a large controlled study and hence is likely inconsequential). This matters because most innovative therapies are developed by clinical observations that lead to those smaller trials, but due to RCT fundamentalism, all of that compelling research is inevitably thrown in the trash. For example, anytime someone uses an effective therapy that competes with the medical monopoly, if costly RCTs have not been performed, the establishment always cries \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence\u201d for the therapy. It uses this to justify stonewalling it and targeting anyone who provides it. Finally, once these provisions became enacted and the FDA began targeting \u201cunapproved\u201d therapies, the number of remarkable medical innovations produced in America dramatically declined. This decline in turn, paralleled the overall decline in disruptive science, which swept America as scientists faced more and more pressure (e.g., from the grant system they depended upon) never to investigate unorthodox ideas that challenged existing paradigms. As such, in recent decades, we\u2019ve had surprisingly few major discoveries that rewrite the rules of science despite the technology that could make those discoveries having significantly advanced. What\u2019s particularly sad about this is that many of the forgotten medical therapies I use in practice were developed between the 1920s to 1960s, as this was the time when technology had advanced enough to begin making \u201ccutting edge\u201d medical therapies, while the censorship apparatus had not yet evolved enough to keep them from seeing the light of day. Because the FDA had rapidly expanded in numerous directions it was not prepared to do, it frequently failed to fulfill its primary responsibilities (e.g., taking something harmful off the market), and it simultaneously took things away Americans actually wanted. This in turn led to numerous committees investigating the FDA (e.g., Commissioner Lay\u2019s Kinslow report of his agency\u2019s serious shortcomings) and key officials with integrity like Lay being kicked out, all of which were encapsulated a series of scathing articles that were published in the New York Times in 1977 (e.g., this, this, this and this one), which included passages such as: But the agency, a bureaucratic waif that is responsible for overseeing a staggering $200 billion worth of products yearly, is not only whipsawed by the public controversy, it is so demoralized that a number of its top positions long go unfilled, so burdened that it cannot keep up with the explosion of consumer goods and so battered by lawsuits and outside pressures that its power to make its decisions stick is sometimes undermined. Its bureaucratic problems have been so vexing that in just the last three years the agency has been the target of more than 100 Congressional investigations, 50 highly critical reports by the General Accounting Office and a series of internal inquiries despairing of ever setting the place right. The Congressional hearings in the last couple of years just about destroyed the agency,\u201d an agency official said privately. \u201cThe staff has been torn by dissension and strife, the morale is bad, there's no direction and stagnation has set in.\u201d Indeed, after his departure as Commissioner of the agency in 1969, Dr. Herbert E. Ley said that \u201cwhat the F.D.A. is doing and what the public thinks it's doing are as different as night and day.\u201d He complained further that during his 18\u2010month tenure he had been under \u201cconstant, tremendous, sometimes unmerciful pressure\u201d from drug industry officials. As problems arise the agency becomes embroiled in thousands of cases, some of which develop into national controversies, and at times it seems that the agency lurches from crisis to crisis. A year ago the Ford Administration was on the verge of releasing an economic\u2010report containing scathing criticism of the agency's utility and effectiveness. The comments were later deleted for unexplained reasons. Key administrative positions at the agency have sometimes gone unfilled for years and as a result various departments have been allowed to drift and founder through lack of leadership and authority. Groups of dissident employees have trooped to Capitol Hill to testify against their superiors, plunging the agency into name\u2010calling internal squabbles that remain unresolved. The internal complaints have also concerned lower level employees, with some agency officials privately describing members of the F.D.A.'s professional staff as \u201cretreads\u201d and \u201chas beens.\u201d In testimony a year ago dealing with low morale at the agency, Dr. J. Richard Crout, director of the Bureau of Drugs, said this about the chaos in which he had found the agency: \u201cThere was an enormous documents room . . . where some people said fights went on and there was absenteeism. There was open drunkenness by several employees, which went on for months. There was intimidation internally. I tell you that in my first year at F.D.A., even lasting longer than that, 1972\u201073, going to certain kinds of meetings was an extraordinarily peculiar kind of exercise. \u201cPeople\u2014I'm talking about division directors and their staffs\u2014would engage in a kind of behavior that invited insubordination. People tittering in corners, throwing spitballs\u2014I'm describing physicians. People who would, let me say, slouch down in a chair, not respond to questions, moan and groan with sweeping gestures, a kind of behavior I have not seen in any other institution as a grown man.\u201d In summing up hearings of the two subcommittees, Senator Kennedy said last summer: \u201cDuring the past two years these subcommittees have received testimony from 30 F.D.A. employees about the practices and internal management of the agency. \u201cThese accounts included serious allegations of undue industry influence, improper transfers, details or removals, alteration of files and forced withdrawal of memoranda, bias toward drug approvals, improper manipulative use of advisory committees, disappearance of critical agency action memoranda into what the F.D.A. Commissioner termed \u2018a mysterious bottomless pit,\u2019 and incredibly slow moving ineffective enforcement and compliance programs with years elapsing between the discovery of a problem and the initiation of a solution, and inappropriate use of medical officer recommendations.\u201d Such disputes wear and divide further an agency that in recent years has been accused in lawsuits of incompetence or wrongdoing, has been investigated more than 100 times by Congressional panels and has had its intent challenged by liberals and conservatives. All the while, new products continue to be spewed out by the score, while the agency says it cannot monitor those already on the market. The 766\u2010page report of the group, headed by Norman Dorsen, a professor at the New York University Law Center, cited detailed cases of harassment of staff by F.D.A. officials, insubordinate behavior by professional staff and inordinate delays in making recommendations on the quality of new drugs. In my eyes, the most important thing about this period of FDA reforms was that the FDA was the most complained about agency in the government, and Congress made numerous attempts to fix it (and ethical FDA officials). Still, nonetheless, the situation described in the NY Times series persisted throughout the agency. Over the last three months, I\u2019ve begun exploring a remarkable forgotten side of medicine\u2014DMSO, a simple and freely available natural chemical that is one of the safest substances in existence and incredibly effective at treating a variety of conditions, including many which are otherwise impossible to treat. In turn, once DMSO discovered in the early 1960s, it spread across the country like wildfire as patients immediately saw it treat a variety of debilitating conditions (e.g., chronic pain or severe arthritis), and researchers realized that it represented a new therapeutic principle that would completely transform medicine. Before long, the entire research community had gotten behind it, as they realized DMSO\u2019s remarkable properties would completely transform the practice of medicine. Likewise, since opening up this topic, I\u2019ve received over a thousand reports from readers who have had almost unbelievable results from DMSO that precisely match what many reported in the 1960s and 1970s. For reference, those conditions included:\u2022Strokes, paralysis, a wide range of neurological disorders (e.g., Down Syndrome and dementia) and many circulatory disorders (e.g., Raynaud\u2019s, varicose veins, hemorrhoids), which I discussed here.\u2022A wide range of tissue injuries such as sprains, concussions, burns, surgical incisions, spinal cord injuries (discussed here).\u2022Chronic pain (e.g., from a bad disc, bursitis, arthiritis or complex regional pain syndrome), which I discussed here.\u2022A wide range of autoimmune, protein and contractile disorders such as scleroderma, amyloidosis, and interstitial cystitis (discussed here).\u2022A variety of head conditions, such as tinnitus, vision loss, dental problems, and sinusitis (discussed here).\u2022A wide range of internal organ diseases such as pancreatitis, infertility, liver cirrhosis (discussed here).\u2022A wide range of cancers, infections, and skin conditions. This all raises a simple question. How is it that no one knows about DMSO or that an agent which could dramatically reduce the need for opioids or prevent millions with stroke and spinal cord injury from having a life of disability never saw the light of day? Quite simply, the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry were initially extremely interested in DMSO. However, once the FDA recognized the scale of new drug applications they would need to process, to get out of having to do that, they reversed their position and declared (without evidence) that DMSO was an extremely dangerous substance, and threatened both the pharmaceutical companies (who had already made significant investments to bring DMSO to market) and each researcher in the country who was giving it to patients in an unapproved manner. Before long, the head of the FDA (Goddard) realized demonizing DMSO (a \u201cdangerous\u201d drug that was rapidly spreading across the country and being used by \u201cirresponsible\u201d researchers in an \u201cunapproved\u201d fashion) would give the FDA justification for the police powers he sought for the agency. In turn, due to both Goddard\u2019s crusade and the FDA (like any other government agency) not wanting ever to admit they had been at fault, the agency continued to double down on the claim \u201cDMSO was dangerous\u201d even after an exhaustive safety study demonstrated that taking 10 times the typical DMSO dose for 90 days posed no risk to human participants.Note: one journalist who interviewed multiple successive FDA commissioners and reviewed all the guidances the FDA put out about DMSO was struck by how little the FDA\u2019s leadership understood about the most controversial drug in America and how misleading and inaccurate (and unreferenced) the FDA\u2019s DMSO guidelines were. Since many people relied upon DMSO to treat their chronic pain (along with a variety of other debilitating injuries), physicians, patients, politicians, and celebrities resisted this encroachment, and after years eventually forced a Congressional and then a Senate hearing. In these hearings, the FDA was confronted with a mountain of evidence (and numerous compelling patient stories) showing DMSO did indeed work (including for numerous terminal conditions which desperately needed treatment). Nonetheless, the FDA continually stuck to the claim there was \u201cno evidence\u201d DMSO worked, as blinded placebo controlled trials had never been conducted with DMSO\u2014something which had never been done because of DMSO\u2019s unique properties (e.g., the temporary skin irritation, characteristic odor and rapid dramatic improvement it frequently causes) made it impossible ever to conduct a truly blinded trial on it. At both hearings, the FDA promised the legislators that any future drug applications for DMSO would be given a fair chance. However, this never happened, and the embargo persisted for decades as the FDA continued to escalate its war against natural medicine. This eventually cumulated in a completely unjustified 1992 raid on a famous integrative medicine clinic (which Dr. Wright describes below). As these events occurred prior to Clinton legalizing direct to consumer pharmaceutical advertising in 1997 (and hence allowing the pharmaceutical industry to buy out the news), a recording of it made the nightly news and quickly went viral across America. Soon after, in 1994, due to outrage over the FDA\u2019s increasingly draconian war against natural medicine, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) passed, a law that essentially took away the FDA\u2019s ability to regulate naturally occurring supplements. Since DMSO was a naturally occurring supplement, this law effectively legalized it, and it is now widely available. It is hence my sincere hope (which appears actually to be occurring now) is that it will be possible for the public to at last remember what was done with DMSO in the 1960s (when hundreds of thousands of Americans used DMSO), and in time this can create the pressure to bring it back to the hospitals, the place where it can most benefit patients (e.g., for strokes). Note: I provided a much longer summary of the FDA\u2019s war against DMSO here as it provided a template for what they\u2019ve done to many other natural therapies. Shortly before the election, RFK Jr. gave what I considered to be one of the most important statements in the entire campaign: This tweet touched upon the fact that for decades the FDA has done everything it can to remove effective natural therapies from the market, something which I believe (but cannot prove) originated from the AMA\u2019s monopolistic tactics which allowed them to become the most powerful force in American medicine. The AMA\u2019s original playbook was to pressure pharmaceutical (or cigarette) companies to sponsor the AMA in return for the AMA\u2019s seal of approval on their pharmaceutical. In time, it evolved into the FDA targeting each viable natural therapy and then pressuring the inventors to sell their rights to the AMA in return for the AMA \u201cproving\u201d the therapy worked, or if they didn\u2019t sell out, the AMA burying it. This for example, is what happened to ultraviolet blood irradiation and numerous remarkable cancer cures (some of which I discussed here and here). As the years moved forward, the government worked in greater and greater coordination with the AMA. Before long the FDA was the primary enforcer of \u201cquackery\u201d the AMA disapproved of, which eventually evolved into the FDA\u2019s war on natural health. For example, in a previous article, I provided a wealth of evidence that demonstrates that restorative sleep is one of the most important things for health and the major issue with sleeping pills\u2014that almost all of them are sedatives that disrupt the natural sleep cycle. However, what many do not know is that one naturally occurring compound (found in foods and the human body), is an incredibly effective sleep aid that enhances restorative sleep. As such, \u03b3-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) was life changing for many (especially the elderly, people in occupations that forced them to have irregular sleeping hours and those with chronic illnesses like fibromyalgia) and at the time it was available, we saw many results physicians now have forgotten are even possible. Unfortunately, the FDA decided they didn\u2019t want a competing sleeping pill on the market and began illegally raiding and arresting those who were providing GHB. Once courts began throwing those convictions out, the FDA then pivoted to creating a national hysteria about GHB being a deadly date rape drug (despite the evidence showing this was not true). Eventually, it was able to attribute GHB to two deadly date rapes (when in reality it was not responsible for either), and pass a national date rape drug law which made GHB a schedule I drug, thereby bypassing its protections as a natural supplement under DSHEA and gave the harshest penalties possible for possessing it. Curiously however, the act also made GHB be a schedule III drug when it was given for an FDA approved use (narcolepsy), and presently costs between $60,000 to $100,000 a year (which patients are willing to pay because of how profoundly it benefits them). Activists in turn, have fought for decades to expand the approved uses of prescribed GHB (something which I believe would profoundly improve America\u2019s health), but aside from one other rare sleep disorder, the FDA has (predictably) refused to do so.Note: GHB also helped with many other issues (e.g., healing tissue and building muscle mass\u2014something typically utilized by bodybuilders but also critically important for the elderly). Most recently, a clinical trial discovered GHB treats laryngeal dystonia (the condition affecting RFK Jr.\u2019s voice). Sadly, that\u2019s not by any means the only example. For example, in RFK Jr\u2019s tweet, he mentioned a few others (e.g., the nutraceuticals and vitamins the FDA has tried to get off the market since Goddard\u2019s time). I will briefly discuss a few of them: \u2022One of the most effective forms of psychotherapy combines it with psychedelics, which unfortunately, given its association with illicit drug use is highly controversial (e.g., most psychedelics are schedule I drugs) and thus has required decades of work to make the FDA open to allowing clinical trials of it. When MDMA is used for psychedelic assisted psychotherapy, it is particularly helpful for veterans with PTSD (of whom roughly 20 commit suicide each day). Given how dire the situation many veterans are in from battlefield trauma (for which conventional medicine has nothing to offer), there has been an immense bipartisan push to conduct the research needed to make it available to veterans. Sadly however, when an FDA panel met to review the (fairly profound) data that had been gathered, they voted 9-2 against approving it, stating more evidence was needed to ascertain that the benefits of the therapy outweighed its risk, largely because the trials weren\u2019t sufficiently blinded and hence not \u201cwell controlled\u201d (essentially the same situation DMSO found itself in as you can\u2019t really conduct blinded psychedelic sessions). As such, this decision was attacked by both the left and right, and American veterans often have to go to Mexico to receive this life saving treatment, something which has sadly been a recurring theme with many of the essential therapies the FDA prohibits.Note: many of the other benefits of psychedelic assisted psychotherapy are discussed here and will be the focus of a future article. \u2022When milk is pasteurized, it denatures the proteins there, destroying many of the essential nutrients present, transforms milk into an allergen, and changes its electrical charge, making it go from a zeta potential enhancing substance to one that impairs it (e.g., causing congestion throughout the body). As such, many believe strongly in only consuming unpasteurized (raw) milk. This position is somewhat controversial because many bacterial illnesses have been traced to unpasteurized milk. However, in most cases, this is due to the milk being filthy in the first place, in essence making pasteurization only necessary for adulterated milk (which sadly characterizes much of the conventional food supply). Because of this, the FDA always tries to shut down anyone selling raw milk, but regardless of what they do, the demand for it persists. \u2022A good case can be made that sunlight is one of the most essential nutrients for life. Unfortunately, since it does not have a lobby to defend it, it\u2019s often a convenient scapegoat for the ill health of our society. The dermatology profession monetized this by associating sunlight exposure with skin cancer, a highly misleading sleight of hand because the common skin cancer (which is never deadly) is associated with sunlight exposure, but the rarer (and deadly) form of skin cancer is actually due to a lack of sunlight exposure (as are many other cancers). Because of this, we are taught to be terrified of the sun giving us a deadly skin cancer, when in reality, it not only doesn\u2019t, but avoiding it dramatically increases our risk of dying (e.g., a large study found smokers who get regular sunlight live longer than non-smokers who avoid the sun). \u2022Chelation therapy (especially when done at a low EDTA dose and without aluminum preservatives) is an incredible therapy that has been used for decades to restore health, particularly within the cardiovascular system (as it both decalcifies the arteries and, when dosed appropriately, restores the physiologic zeta potential). Sadly, the FDA has continually targeted physicians who practiced it for decades (however in 1978 and 1981, courts ruled against the FDA prohibiting doctors from conducting this practice) and still is antagonistic towards it (despite a large NIH study that was somewhat set up to fail nonetheless demonstrating EDTA helped cardiovascular disease). \u2022When used appropriately (which often requires avoiding higher doses), peptide therapy is remarkably effective for a variety of ailments. Unfortunately, the FDA has also been antagonistic towards these supplements, and this accelerated during the Biden presidency (e.g., it\u2019s no longer possible to get some of the most important injectable ones). \u2022Umbilical cord blood stem cells (obtained from placentas that would otherwise be thrown away) are another truly remarkable therapy, and when used correctly, can produce life-changing results. Unfortunately, during the Biden administration, the FDA changed its regulations on cord blood stem cells and effectively made it impossible for the \u201cunproven\u201d product to be sold within the country, causing the companies that had built up an infrastructure to produce them to have to shut down (as there was no feasible way to get the FDA approval necessary to sell them). Note: many other dysfunctional regulations also need to be addressed. For example, since the FDA will target anyone who sells infant formula made without seed oils, it\u2019s impossible to find seed-oil free infant formula.  This arose from the Infant Formula Act of 1980 (which was virtually unanimously passed by Congress in response to more than 100 infants becoming seriously ill from nutritionally inadequate soybean oil-based formulas), as it contained outdated science from the 1970s (specifically these 1976 AAP recommendations which did not exist in the AAP\u2019s 1967 recommendations), that required infant formulas to have at least 2.7% of its calories (300mg per 100 Kcal) comes from linoleic acid (the problematic fat in seed oils). Beyond this making it illegal to sell infant formula without them, I and many others believe this is a root cause of the childhood obesity epidemic in America as seed oils impair mitochondrial metabolism and cause you to gain weight (e.g., this systematic review shows infant formulas cause excessive and rapid weight gain). As the law was written, the Secretary of Health and Human Services had the latitude to revise those outdated nutritional guidelines (but essentially never has). Many have been horrified to learn that the FDA and CDC systematically ignored every possible sign the COVID vaccines were dangerous as they pushed it on more and more people (e.g., in this leaked recording, consider how stubbornly the head of FDA\u2019s vaccine division refuses to acknowledge any of the evidence brought forward by a group of permanently injured vaccine recipients). This severe betrayal of trust from our authorities thus made many ask, \u201cHow could this have happened?\u201d In truth, this did not come out of nowhere. Rather it was simply the subsequent escalation of a longstanding tendency by the government to push vaccines they knew were unsafe and ineffective to market, synopsized in this remarkable presentation by Suzanne Humphries, MD, and covered in much more detail in this article: In Humphries talk, she briefly mentions the following: \u2022Throughout the history of vaccination, many vaccine disasters have occurred from hot lots being released that injured or killed large numbers of people (particularly in the military). While most of these were swept under the rug, at the end of his career, one eminent bacteriologist compiled all the instances he could get records of (which I detailed here).Note: in my opinion, the evidence I compiled demonstrates that hot lots (adulterated vaccines) are such a frequent consequence of vaccination, it is virtually inevitable hot lots will keep on hitting the market (e.g., we now have proof this was a vital issue with COVID vaccine toxicity). As such, I believe the only viable option is to have independent third-party testing (with a robust system of audits for the testers so they can\u2019t get co-opted by industry) of all vaccines. This is the standard that many other industries are held to (e.g., many products made by compounding pharmacies), so there should be no reason why it can\u2019t also be applied to vaccines. \u2022When developing the polio vaccine, a key challenge Salk faced was administering enough formaldehyde to the polio virus to inactivate the virus but not enough that it deformed it to the point it could no longer solicit a sufficient antibody response. Due to the national fear surrounding polio, an \u201cemergency\u201d existed which justified an expedited 1955 approval and Salk advocating for an (untested) accelerated manufacturing process which was at risk of containing live polio viruses. Then, two weeks after the vaccine was released, cases began emerging across America of children who had become paralyzed in the limb that was injected with Salk\u2019s polio vaccine.Note: to produce the emergency COVID vaccines at scale, a novel manufacturing process was used, which caused them to be contaminated with dangerous DNA-altering bacterial plasmids. In the subsequent investigation, it was discovered that many of the labs that produced the polio vaccines had never had their product tested on humans, and an NIH researcher (Bernice Eddy) had already discovered that those vaccines caused polio. Still, her bosses decided to release the vaccine nonetheless. \u2022Five years later (in 1960), Eddy also discovered that the polio vaccines were contaminated with a cancer causing virus (SV-40). Her superiors (who\u2019d already discovered it the previous year) decided not to disclose her findings to the public (to maintain public trust in the vaccine program). Eddy then bravely presented them at a cancer conference, after which she was demoted and lost her lab. It was not until 1963 (as evidence of the problem continued to mount) that the federal government forced the vaccine manufacturers to stop growing the vaccine on SV-40 contaminated monkey kidneys\u2014at which point between 40-98 million Americans (and many more globally) were infected\u2014although a case can be made SV-40 was present until around the year 2000 in some of the vaccines (e.g., we still frequently find it is critical to treat the SV-40 component of cancer). This caused a massive cancer wave, which until the even worse COVID-19 vaccines, was completely unprecedented in American history. \u2022When the earliest influenza vaccines hit the market in 1945, Joseph Anthony Morris PhD was recruited by the Division of Biologics Standards (DBS) to assess vaccine safety and efficacy, eventually becoming the Chief Vaccine Control Officer. Morris discovered the influenza vaccines were unsafe and only worked between 0-40% of the time, and had safety issues. Still, his superiors ignored his data and released the \u201csafe and effective\u201d flu shots. Like Eddy, Morris also faced significant retaliation, being harassed, demoted, losing access to his lab, and blocked from publishing his results. Before being fired, Morris decided to fight the FDA\u2019s gross misconduct by hiring a lawyer and going to the Senate. This prompted a 1972 Senate hearing, which concluded that the issues Morris raised were only the tip of the iceberg. As a result of the hearing, thirty-two unsafe and unproven vaccines were taken off the market. Most of the DBS\u2019s conduct was deemed so egregious that it was scrapped and replaced with a division in the FDA (which unfortunately did not fix the rot within the agency). After being transferred to the new FDA agency, Morris continued to be responsible for overseeing our influenza vaccines. Then, in February of 1976, a swine flu strain was found in a soldier who died in March, leading to the government trying to drum up as much fear as possible about an apocalyptic repeat of the 1918 influenza. Morris was called to investigate and (correctly) proved this swine flu posed no risk whatsoever to America. Since that swine flu strain reproduced slowly, it was not feasible to produce enough of it to make a vaccine before the \u201cpandemic\u201d faded into memory, so they hybridized it with the fast-growing 1918 influenza. Morris thought this was insane, but was again gagged by his superiors, so he went on a national speaking tour and was given a platform by sympathetic television hosts (as the pharmaceutical industry had not yet bought out the media). Sadly, Morris was not listened to, and the experimental vaccine was distributed across America. Before long, the injuries piled up, with hundreds becoming paralyzed from Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, dozens dying, and thousands of lawsuits being filed.Note: given that I and colleagues knew many people who were severely injured by this vaccine, I am relatively certain the official figures I just cited significantly understated the actual number of injuries. However, the one bright side to this was it occurred in an era when 60 Minutes was willing to do a segment on the disaster (which has numerous remarkable parallels to what happened during COVID-19). Many more disasters were also green-lighted by the FDA. For example: \u2022During the Gulf War, a faction within the Department of Defense (DoD) which was deeply invested in bioweapons research, convinced the military to give American soldiers a variety of agents to protect American troops from Saddam Hussein\u2019s suspected biological and chemical weapons. Since, many of the agents they used were experimental, the DoD convinced the FDA to author an \u201cInterim Rule,\u201d which gave the FDA commissioner the authority to override all the protections soldiers had against receiving experimental drugs (e.g., informed consent) if the commissioner deemed doing so necessary for a military objective. Unfortunately, the military failed to follow the procedures the FDA had laid out to test experimental agents on soldiers. This ended up being a massive issue because approximately 250,000 of the 697,000 U.S. veterans developed a severe chronic illness known as Gulf War Syndrome that was tied to these experimental agents, particularly the anthrax vaccine (whereas in contrast, Hussein never deployed biological or chemical weapons on US troops). Remarkably, rather than pull the vaccine, the military continued to mandate it on our troops, and eventually in 1998, the FDA forced the manufacturer to temporarily stop production, due to their rushed \u201cemergency\u201d vaccines being heavily adulterated and much different from had been promised (and likely why it injured so many people). Note: the devastation of the anthrax vaccines is hard to put into words and in many ways, served as a blueprint for the cruel military COVID-19 mandates. I covered it in more detail here. \u2022In the lead up to the second Iraq war, George Bush tried to create a national hysteria about Hussein releasing smallpox on America (which he never had). He began a mandatory vaccine campaign within the military (and a voluntary one for first responders), which was then stopped midway (after 578,286 military personnel and 39,353 healthcare workers had been vaccinated) due to it causing myocarditis.Note: those events (and the media coverage) are detailed further here. As best as I can tell, the FDA enabled this one to happen, but was not as belligerent in protecting the vaccine as it had been in the other incidents. \u2022To make a lot of money, Merck pushed a new vaccine onto the market which could \u201cprevent\u201d cervical cancer, and then did a massive marketing campaign in coordination with the CDC and FDA to scare people senseless about cervical cancer (a relatively rare cancer). During the vaccine trials (in healthy young girls), an extraordinarily high rate of (often permanent) injuries happened (e.g., at least 2.3% developed permanent autoimmune disorders and 0.085% died). To hide this, Merck gave a harmful \u201cplacebo\u201d (the autoimmune triggering vaccine adjuvant) to the control group, so the high rate of injuries in the vaccine group would be comparable to the \u201cplacebo\u201d and thus not linkable to the vaccine. Once the HPV vaccine hit the market, the FDA was immediately deluged with reports of severe vaccine injuries (on a scale that had never been seen with any previous vaccine). Still, the FDA and CDC chose to do everything they could to protect (and promote) the vaccine regardless of the public protest it received. Much later, it was also discovered the trial data showed the vaccine increased your risk of developing cervical cancer if you were already vaccinated. Twenty years later, there\u2019s very little evidence the vaccine reduced cervical cancer at all (which it was never actually proven to do) and quite possibly increased it.Note: the parallels between what happened with the HPV and COVID vaccine disasters are extraordinary, and I covered them here. Sadly, the FDA\u2019s tendency to relentlessly protect a drug it approves is not unique to vaccines (e.g., consider Dr. Graham\u2019s testimony about Vioxx at the start of the article). Of those scandals, I believe the SSRI antidepressant saga (detailed here) provides the closest template of what happened with the COVID vaccines. When the SSRIs were originally developed, the evidence for them was so poor, it took (admitted) bribery to get the first one, Prozac, approved. Since the Bush family had close ties to Prozac\u2019s manufacturer, once it got an overseas approval, George HW Bush pushed it through here. Unfortunately, the SSRIs, beyond having very poor evidence they helped depression, had a variety of frequent severe side effects, including frequently emotionally anesthetizing the recipients, 20-40% of users developing Bipolar syndrome, 59% getting sexual dysfunction (which makes you depressed), and a 255% increase in suicidal tendencies. Worse still, they had a tendency to cause violent and psychotic behavior (e.g., mass shootings, grisly homicides, and most commonly violent suicides), frequently causing the user to behave in a manner sometimes analogized to \u201cbeing possessed.\u201d Because of this, once the SSRIs came out, the extraordinary personality changes they created caused them to rapidly become the most complained about drug in America. Remarkably however, the FDA refused to listen to the public, and even gagged their own scientist from publishing a report showing they caused children to commit suicide. Much later, lawsuits revealed all these issues were discovered throughout the clinical trials, but the FDA hid it from the public, and to this day still relentlessly defends the drugs. Note: as part of their defense against SSRI suicide lawsuit, Pfizer paid lawyer Dan Troy 358,000.00 for some legal \u201cwork\u201d shortly before Bush appointed him the FDA\u2019s chief council in 2001 (despite the fact he\u2019d represented both the tobacco industry and pharmaceutical industry in court). Once there, the FDA began interceding to defend SSRI manufacturers being sued in court (which worked). Additionally, while there he issued a new policy requiring all warning letters to drug companies and medical device manufacturers to be approved by his office. In the wake of the new policy, the number of warning letters issued by the agency dropped by 70%, further worsening the FDA\u2019s already lax enforcement. Many other controversial approvals can be cited as well. Of these, the most recent one happened with a new Alzheimer\u2019s drugs that eliminate amyloid plaque from the brain (something which few know the brain actually produces to protect itself from damage). The first drug failed to show any improvement for Alzheimer's disease, while brain swelling or brain bleeding was found in 41% of patients enrolled in its studies, resulting in the FDA\u2019s advisory panel (which typically votes yes) voting 10-1 not to approve it. Nonetheless, the FDA overrode their panel, leading to three resigning from the panel. Congress then investigated the approval (because the drug was so expensive it had the potential to bankrupt Medicare) and discovered numerous red flags (e.g., the FDA sidelined its scientists who raised concerns about it, and the FDA helped the manufacturer prepare its presentation to the FDA advisory committee). Despite all this, the FDA kept it on the market, but fortunately, it was so unsafe and ineffective, that doctors were unwilling to use it, and before long the manufacturer was forced to pull it from the market. Shortly after, another Alzheimer\u2019s drug was brought to the FDA, and this time, the commissioner decided to bypass the advisory panel and instead gave it a backdoor approval. Immediately after, he was a keynote speakerat an annual pharmaceutical investment conference where JP Morgan hyped up the incredible profits both the new Alzheimer\u2019s and Obesity drugs (e.g., Ozempic) would offer in the years to come. As you might expect, when each of those Alzheimer\u2019s drugs was approved, the agency released a glowing press release and since then has pushed Ozempic on America\u2019s children. At this point, I\u2019ve seen a variety of proposals put forward to fix the FDA, which alternate between reforming the agency (e.g., Robert Malone wrote one of the best summaries of what needs to be done in this regard) and scrapping the agency entirely. In my eyes, the core dilemmas are: \u2022The FDA performs a variety of necessary functions to protect the public, so eliminating it entirely would be a disaster. Likewise, if it were scrapped (like the DBS was in 1972), whatever followed it would likely be just as bad if not worse because too many of the bad parts would remain.\u2022Because corruption has been so systemic within the FDA, even when someone who genuinely wants to reform the agency takes charge, their efforts go nowhere, and are quickly overridden by a corrupt successor. As such, the majority of reforms proposed are likely only to create a fleeting impact.\u2022The task the FDA has to do is so immense it\u2019s simply impossible for them to get everything done. Because of this, they regularly outsource evaluating safety and efficacy to pharmaceutical companies (which essentially defeats the point of having the FDA exist to protect the public) and make drug approval a pay-to-play situation where approval is based on how much money you put in, not the quality of your product.\u2022Like many government agencies, the FDA never likes to admit it was wrong, so once a drug is approved (e.g., by the right people being bribed), regardless of what the public does or what data emerges, it will almost never revoke that approval (e.g., consider what we\u2019ve seen throughout COVID-19).\u2022Since the FDA\u2019s resources are limited, it will always default to attacking natural medicine, as unlike pharmaceutical companies, natural medicine providers can\u2019t fight back, thereby allowing the FDA to create the facade of protecting the public without having to fear lobbyists getting the government to retaliate against the FDA. In essence, all the agency's issues can be boiled down to \u201cselective prosecution.\u201dNote: similarly, the natural health industry can\u2019t bribe FDA employees with future high paying jobs, whereas the pharmaceutical industry routinely does that. In my eyes, the best solution to this problem is hence to restructure the FDA (and the public\u2019s relation to it) so that the systemic corruption within the agency (which is almost inevitable given how much money lies in medicine) does not prevent it from serving the public interest. Fortunately, there are quite a few ways to do this. A few of the ideas I\u2019ve looked at include: 1. Have a law in place that voids the vote of anyone in a healthcare related committee or panel who is later shown to have (or to develop) financial conflicts of interest with the relevant pharmaceutical company, which then reverses decisions that would no longer pass once the corrupt vote was nullified, and similarly to apply the same standard to individual regulators who push drugs through. If this is in place, it makes it much harder to bribe healthcare decision makers (as one of the most common forms of bribery is providing a lucrative job or grant to them after they help the company\u2014e.g., the FDA commissioners who pushed the COVID vaccines all subsequently got lavish jobs with their manufacturers). 2. While I believe it\u2019s essential for the FDA to evaluate safety and ensure products contain what they claim, virtually everyone I\u2019ve spoken to believes the FDA should not be responsible for assessing efficacy. This is because \u201cefficacy\u201d is an incredibly subjective metric, and time and time again, you will see the FDA approve a drug for an inconsequential \u201cbenefit\u201d (which was likely the result of statistical manipulation of the trial data or outright fraud), but simultaneously refuse to approve a drug with a wealth of evidence behind it. As such, two parallel approval tracks needed to be created:\u2022One that follows the existing framework and makes medications eligible for insurance reimbursement.\u2022One for alternative therapies that have a longstanding record of safety (e.g., ultraviolet blood irradiation has been in regular use for almost 100 years and demonstrated a high degree of safety throughout that period) but with divided opinions on their efficacy. Therapies in this category would not require FDA \u201capproval\u201d to be used (or studied in community trials), provided their safety is superior to the existing therapeutic options.Note: many have recognized the need for this alternative track over the decades (e.g., throughout the AIDS crisis, physicians [and legislators] across America fought to get FDA approval for community trials for therapies that were saving AIDS patients), and the Right To Try Act passed during Trump\u2019s first term attempted to do this. Unfortunately, the terms of that act were too restrictive. For example, when we tried to use that law during COVID, we found it still was not possible to use \u201cexperimental\u201d therapies (with supportive data but not an FDA approval) on patients who were otherwise expected to die (and then typically did).3. Currently, our entire system judges efficacy by the FDA\u2019s seal of approval, when in reality that seal is often highly misleading. As such, I (and many others) believe the marketplace is actually a better metric for determining efficacy, as consumers will typically only pay for things they have a strong basis to believe work (whereas many of the costly therapies patients receive they would never purchase were insurance not covering them). Note: this policy would also require the justice system, medical boards, and malpractice lawsuits to recognize the validity of the second category (whereas since they currently don\u2019t, that legal liability is one of the primary reasons why many doctors will not use \u201cunapproved\u201d therapies). 4. The evaluation of drugs and pharmaceuticals needs to be done in collaboration with the public. Presently, there is simply too much data for the drug regulators to be able to go through, so without members of the public (or AI systems the public has access to) evaluating the data pool, critical red flags will be missed and not be acted upon. For example, during COVID, a community of independent scientific journalists who, with minimal data, were able to rapidly identify a wide range of safety signals, regulators around the world had missed. Given that COVID was the primary focus of the regulatory agencies, this suggests that many other critical items are being overlooked and that outside observers are required to identify them. 5. Similarly, during the drug approval process, the data that led to drug approval needs to be available for the public to examine (rather than only being attainable through a drawn-out legal process). If this had been done, the systemic fraud throughout the COVID trials and the lack of safety or efficacy from the vaccines would have been immediately exposed (rather than the FDA ignoring those reports and instead reporting the whistleblowers to Pfizer). Sadly, this issue is by no means unique to the COVID vaccines (the actual data on many approved drugs is atrocious), and were it known, many would immediately be pulled from the market. 6. There need to be ways to revoke a drug approval if the FDA continues to protect a lousy drug, which as things like Vioxx, the SSRIs and many catastrophic vaccines show, it always does regardless of how strong the data is against the pharmaceutical or how much public protest it meets. Remarkably, at this point, it can\u2019t even be done at a state level (as much in the same way the Supreme Court prohibited states from banning toxic food additives, courts have found FDA approvals supersede state laws). The only remedy is a protracted court process, which if lucky can force the FDA to require a warning label on the drug. Exactly how this provision would be implemented is less clear, as if it\u2019s simply shunted to another agency, lobbyists can still overturn any attempts to prohibit it. As present, the best solutions I\u2019ve come up with are to:\u2022Lower the bar required to successfully sue the manufacturer of an FDA approved drug or the prescribing physician if the effect was not adequately disclosed or monitored (as if doctors did that, patients would not want to take the more toxic drugs, and doctors would prescribe far less of them).\u2022Restore a state\u2019s right to ban drugs.\u2022Give courts the legal authority to pull dangerous drugs.\u2022Have a provision in place where if a sufficient number of individuals sign a petition to have a drug\u2019s safety re-evaluated, a committee is randomly selected from a large pool of applicants that can evaluate the existing evidence from both sides and then override the FDA\u2019s approval if significant safety concerns exist.Note: the intention behind pulling from such a large pool of potential experts is to make it impossible to buy out the committee (which typically is what always happens). In my eyes, the primary thing which characterizes the modern era is longstanding paradigms rapidly changing (think how different the world has become each decade compared to how slowly things changed a few hundred years ago). One of the most tremendous forces accelerating this process has been social media (particularly Twitter) breaking the stranglehold on truth the legacy media once had. For almost a century, public policy has been decided by narratives being disseminated in unison by all the major media outlets, but now that they no longer have a monopoly on information, counter narratives can quickly go viral, and if they have a strong validity behind them, rapidly outcompete the mass media\u2019s propaganda. As such, there is now much more pressure on authorities to be truthful, and as blatant lies are becoming much easier to expose. Similarly, the primary reason groups like the FDA or the CDC have had so much power has arisen from so many other organizations deferring to their guidance, and the media in lockstep supporting it. Ultimately, I believe that if we want to Make America Healthy Again, the solution will not be to try to \u201cfix\u201d the government but rather use the limited window we have now to rapidly accelerate the public\u2019s ability to become directly involved in healthcare policy, as that way, even if the government changes, the public will still be able to counteract its bureaucratic encroachment effectively. For example, there has been a longstanding embargo on obtaining any medical data which threatens government or corporate interests. A key point RFK Jr. has campaigned on is making the CDC\u2019s Vaccine Safety Database (compiled from a large number of electronic health care records) available to the public, as this would likely immediately give rapid and incontestable proof vaccines aren\u2019t \u201csafe and effective.\u201d Likewise, I know existing artificial intelligence could do the same for many other pharmaceuticals if they had access to the EHRs. Immediately, both flag the most dangerous drugs but also tell us precisely how much they actually harm or benefit patients (which in turn would lead to many bad drugs rapidly being taken off the market). Likewise, there has also been a longstanding embargo on testing any integrative therapy that performs significantly better than the existing standard of care (e.g., we\u2019ve tried numerous times, but the FDA makes it almost impossible to conduct those trials\u2014so it is again possible to argue there is \u201cno evidence\u201d). As such, when I learned RFK Jr. was going to announce his candidacy, I did a variety of things to help promote it. Then I shifted my focus to trying to make the case for the integrative therapies I believed would be the most likely to show a rapid benefit for hospitalized patients (e.g., ultraviolet blood irradiation and DMSO).This was done under the logic that if a clear and substantial benefit could be proven for the therapies (which could be done the fastest for hospitalized patients), it would be impossible to put the cat back into the bag as the public would quickly start demanding those therapies in the hospitals. At that point, they could diffuse into general use outside of a hospital setting. Note: through my network, I know that there are numerous hospitals and physicians who want to conduct those trials, so if the FDA\u2019s barriers to them were removed and hospitals were rewarded by Medicare rather than penalized for doing so, they could get off the ground quite quickly. Likewise, I know there is considerable interest in community based trials of these therapies, provided the red tape is removed. Most importantly, all of these incredible possibilities are only possible because of the work all of you have done to fight back against the COVID cartel and help shift society towards embracing a model of healthcare that puts people before profits. On the one hand, I am incredibly grateful to all of you for helping to bring this to pass (and spent much of Thanksgiving thinking about that), but on the other hand, it also means the next four years will be the time when each of us needs to become actively involved in improving America\u2019s health, as that\u2019s what we genuinely need to change things now.

However, the buzz was short-lived, and now the Chinese economy faces a bleak outlook in 2025. The slowdown in domestic consumption and manufacturing, the real estate slump and the return of Donald Trump apparently have put the brakes on economic improvement. Beijing recently came up with measures to boost equity markets as consumer sentiments have gone downhill, as per JP Morgan. \u201cNegative wealth effects for Chinese households caused by falling property prices have been compounded by a simultaneous decline in equity markets and falling interest rates on deposits, leading to lower confidence,\u201d it said. World Bank said the objectives of the stimulus measures remain unclear as China grapples with a property crisis and an ageing population. \u201cThe question is whether [the stimulus] can actually offset consumer concerns about declining salaries, concerns about declining property incomes and fears about falling ill, growing old, becoming unemployed,\u201d said Aaditya Mattoo, East Asia and Pacific chief economist at the World Bank. And China now is not in the position to support economic recovery through monetary stimulus, said Erik Lueth, global emerging market economist at Legal and General IM. The recently announced stimulus measures were aimed at stimulating the economy and stabilizing markets. But they failed as Chinese markets fell. \u201cWhile government actions have bolstered optimism, analysts caution that the rally is based on \u201cunrealistic expectations\u201d of the impact of government stimulus, and that it may be too soon to make any substantial upgrades to Chinese equities,\u201d said Wright Research. All major Wall Street analysts have warned of bad days for China in 2025 when the global economy is expected to grow solidly. World Bank has downgraded the GDP growth for China in 2025 to 4.3 percent. JP Morgan said the harsh regulations in China have negatively impacted the profitability of Chinese companies and stock markets. \u201cEarnings per share growth has not been able to keep up with economic growth over the last 10 years, while return on equity fell from 15 percent to 11 percent,\u201d it said. In May 2024, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) upgraded the Chinese economy\u2019s growth forecast for 2025 by 0.4 percentage points even as it warned of risks. Now the forecast has become negative. IMF\u2019s First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath said the sluggish recovery post-Covid had dented stock market prospects. \u201cRisks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, including from a greater or longer-than-expected property sector readjustment and increasing fragmentation pressures,\u201d\u00a0she had said. Morgan Stanley has downgraded China to slight \u201cunderweight\u201d from \u201cequal weight\u201d thanks to concerns over corporate earnings and market valuation. Goldman Sachs said valuations were not demanding. \u201cThe property and retail sectors remain under pressure and the economy may not benefit as much from policy support in China as it previously has, given China\u2019s focus on bolstering the domestic economy,\u201d it said. Trump has announced to impose of up to 60 percent tariffs on Chinese goods. Chinese economic growth would be cut by 0.7 percent even if 20 percent tariffs are imposed, as per Goldman Sachs. China must take precautions, said Huang Yiping, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the People\u2019s Bank of China and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange\u2019s Mainland China Advisory Group. \u201cDonald Trump is very likely to further hike tariffs to target China. Beijing should take precautions by rolling out more measures to stabilise and spur domestic demand,\u201d he said. Global investors are apprehensive of the huge negative impact on the Chinese stock market that a Trump decision can make. Rong Ren Goh, a portfolio manager at Eastspring Investments said foreign investors may position themselves defensively on any China-related assets. \u201cRight now, the markets are focusing narrowly on the prospect of tariffs because it is the easiest lever to pull directly under a presidential executive order, but we\u2019ve seen between 2016-20 other levers that can be pulled to contain China,\u201d he said. The Trump effect was brightly demonstrated after Chinese markets reacted sharply to the US election outcome. And China now is not in the position to support economic recovery through monetary stimulus, said Erik Lueth, global emerging market economist at Legal and General IM. \u201cWe are in a typical liquidity trap and we don\u2019t think that, at the stage where we are, this will do the trick,\u201d he said.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. JP Morgan analyst Reginald L. Smith noted that 2024 was a tale of two halves for fintech stocks. After a lagging start to the year, the aggregate market cap of the analyst\u2019s fintech coverage universe has increased more than $65 billion since mid-September, fueled by cheerful calendar third-quarter 2024 results and management commentary, two rate cuts, and the U.S. Presidential Election. In fiscal 2025, lower benchmark rates and an improved third-party funding environment should spur increased loan origination volume and healthier gain-on-sale (GOS) margins for fintech lenders. However, Smith remains cautious about fintech lenders at current levels and noted investors will find a more attractive entry point following the calendar fourth-quarter earnings cycle. Also Read: CrowdStrike Sees Strong Module Adoption, Valuation Concerns Persist: Analysts Smith downgraded Upstart Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UPST) from Neutral to Underweight and raised the price target from\u00a0$45\u00a0to\u00a0$57. Upstart Holdings benefits from a powerful flywheel effect that creates a virtuous cycle whereby more excellent repayment data leads to improved risk and fraud detection, which leads to higher approval rates and increased volume. Smith noted the potential of Upstart Holdings\u2019 AI lending platform, especially in light of an improving consumer credit and loan funding environment, and is encouraged by the company\u2019s increasingly durable capital base, but continues to struggle with valuation and noted shares are pricing in a snap-back to fiscal 2022-level of originations, which is at least a few quarters away. The price target boost reflects improving funding conditions and stabilizing credit trends. The price target applies a ~5.5x multiple to Smith\u2019s calendar year 2026 revenue estimate, a slight premium to its TTM P\/S ratio, which he noted as fair given rates remain relatively high, and Upstart\u2019s own UMI suggests the macro environment is causing default rates to be above 40% above historical levels. The rerating reflects Upstart Holdings\u2019 ~$13 billion annualized origination volume the last time the stock traded in the high $70 range. Smith projected a fourth quarter of $180 million and an adjusted EPS of $(0.04). Smith downgraded LendingClub Corp (NYSE:LC) from Overweight to Neutral and raised the price target from\u00a0$14\u00a0to\u00a0$17. Smith noted LendingClub\u2019s marketplace-bank model, which combines a marketplace\u2019s fee income with a bank\u2019s interest income, personal loan market opportunity, and competitive positioning. Investor concern has shifted from the credit quality of their loan portfolio to the availability of third-party funding and the company\u2019s ability to grow its balance sheet and improve ROTE. The rerating reflects the company\u2019s roadmap, but it could take several quarters to play out, and the analyst prefers names with more visible near-term growth and monetization opportunities. The analyst raised the price target to reflect tangible book multiple to 1.4x (from 1.2x) on improving credit trends and demand in the loan funding market, implying a modest discount to the SMID-cap bank average (1.7x), which he noted as fair until LC increases ROTCE (currently low single digits) to the SMID-Cap bank average through balance sheet growth and non-interest income. Smith projected a fourth quarter of $210 million and an adjusted EPS of $0.10. Smith maintained SoFi Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:SOFI) with a Neutral and raised the price target from\u00a0$9\u00a0to\u00a0$16. Smith flagged SoFi\u2019s positioning and go-to-market strategy and noted the company would ultimately be a winner in the neo\/digital bank space and could eventually become the \u201cAmerican Express\u201d of fintech. That said, SoFi\u2019s accounting methodology, precisely its fair value discount rate assumptions, are meaningfully lower than peers\u2019 and remain a hot button for investors, likely limiting near-term stock upside. SoFi currently trades at 3.8x tangible book. The price target reflects the promising outlook of non-interest income growth and improving GAAP profitability. Smith projected a fourth quarter of $679 million and an adjusted EPS of $0.04. Price Actions: UPST stock is down 13.2% at $68.42 at last check Monday. LC is down 6.19%, and SOFI is down 2.47%.

The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. On Thursday, JP Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers raised the price target on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) to $1,090 (from $945 prior) while maintaining an Overweight rating following November sales results. The company reported net sales of $21.87 billion for the retail month of November (four weeks ending December 1, 2024), reflecting a 5.6% increase from $20.71 billion last year. For the twelve-week first quarter ending November 24, 2024, net sales reached $60.99 billion, up 7.5% from $56.72 billion last year. Net sales for the first thirteen weeks totaled $66.52 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to $62.04 billion in the prior year. E-commerce sales in November were down by an estimated 15 percentage points due to the later timing of Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday this year compared to last year. This shift resulted in a roughly 1.5% decrease in total and comparable sales. The analyst writes that they continue to believe that COST remains a core holding due to its unmatched value proposition, characterized by 11% gross margins, a loyal customer base with a ~90% renewal rate, and a global growth opportunity of 2%-3% annually. The analyst adds that this combination is rare in retail and consumer staples, with the potential to double its current store base. The latter is its GICS classification. The analyst adds that Costco continues to outperform most of retail in terms of share gains and traffic trends, particularly due to its 70% consumable assortment. For December, the analyst expects core U.S. comps to be +6.7%, Canada to +8.2%, and Other International to +9.0%, resulting in a total company core comp of +7.2%. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via\u00a0Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF\u00a0(NYSE:VDC) and\u00a0Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF\u00a0(NYSE:FSTA). Price Action: COST shares are down 0.49% at $986.06 at the last check Thursday.

CNBC\u2019s Bob Pisani did a wonderful remembrance of Art: \u201cIn the intensely competitive and often vicious world of stock market commentary, Cashin was that rarest of creatures: a man respected by all, bulls and bears, liberals and conservatives alike.\u201d It made me want to share a few of my favorite Art Cashin stories\u2026 I first met Art when I was a newbie strategist in the 2000s. He had been on the NYSE floor for longer than I had been alive. He knew things, had seen things, and, during his tenure, was able to apply those experiences to markets. His insights were unique, and I always received them with gratitude. He was always very generous with me, allowing many of his unique works to be republished on this blog (despite the usual concerns from compliance). My buddy Mark Lehman had been at UBS in Switzerland for nearly his entire career. He had been part of the UBS Wednesday calls with Art since 1997 (when he transferred to the NY office, he was still technically a Geneva employee.) Mark introduced me to Art sometime in the mid-2000s, pre-GFC. He recalls, \u201cThere always was a Dewar\u2019s and ice ready for when Arthur arrived at Bobby Vans.\u201d At the time, I had been writing about subprime mortgages, derivatives, and other elements of risk that had been widely ignored by The Street. Art wanted his crew to at least consider these risks, which so many were overlooking. He invited me to present to that audience on his morning call to the firm\u2014around 2008(?). The fact that Cashin had brought me on gave me needed credibility, and a very respectful audience peppered me with questions. I would occasionally sneak down to the Bobby Vans across from the NYSE after the close, where the FOF crew \u2013 Friends of Fermentation \u2013 perfected the art of marinating ice cubes. Any chance you could get to spend time with him was always well spent. He had me back to UBS discuss Bailout Nation (was it in \u201809 or \u201810?). He generously introduced me to that crew, reminding them of my prior visit. A few years later, he was the keynote Fireside chat at the Big Picture conference.  Cashin announced he would be speaking at the TBP conference with his usual understated humility: \u201cHe invited me to end the conference with a somewhat informal fireside chat\u2014just a few anecdotes from 50 years in the game. I hope they frisk the audience for spoiled fruit or hard rolls. It should be fun\u2014for me at least.\u201d Never one to stand between a crowd and Happy Hour, he began the final session of the day by saying, \u201cThe New York State Liquor Authority and the New York Bartenders Association have asked me to be brief.\u201d A few other stories stand out from that event: Art the Musician: \u201cIt was the beginning of the age of folk music, I figure if I\u2019m going to make $39 a week [at the NYSE] I can do better than this\u2026 so I put together a group. I talked my way into an audition\u2026 with the Chairman of ABC\/Paramount Records. We performed some songs and the execs said that if the guy they had just seen didn\u2019t work out, they would sign us to a record deal. The guy they had just seen, however, was Ray Charles. So I went back to Wall Street,\u201d Cashin told the laughing crowd. Price discovery: Louis Tiffany knew JP Morgan loved diamond stick pens. He delivered one to JPM with a note: \u201cThe pen is $5,000. If you choose to accept it, you can send your man over to my office with the $5,000; if you choose not to, you can send your man over with the pen.\u201d The next day, JPM\u2019s man went to Tiffany with a note and the pen box. The note said, \u201c$5,000 was too much; enclosed is a check for $4,000.\u201d JPM\u2019s note said that if Tiffany didn\u2019t want the deal, he could send back the $4,000 check and keep the pen. Tiffany knew he had the right price for the pen, so he decided to send the check back. When he opened the pen box, though, he didn\u2019t find the pen! Instead, there was a check for $5,000 with a note from JPM: \u201cJust checking the price.\u201d End of the World: \u201cMost of what I learned came from sitting in saloons that had encyclopedias behind the bar \u2013 usually to settle bets. The things I learned in the saloons were not the same things you learn in places like the Sloan School of Management \u2013 usually they were better. For example, there was the lesson I learned during the Cuban Missile Crisis. At the time I was studying with \u201cProfessor Jack\u201d under a Moosehead, in a saloon called \u201cEberlin\u2019s\u201d down the block from the exchange. The tuition was paid in scotch \u201cold fashions.\u201d Classes lasted until either you ran out of money to buy drinks or Jack ran out of the ability to stand. Jack was actually a 62 year-old trader in silver stocks but he had more in his head than is in most university libraries. Anyway, it was the Cuban Missile Crisis and there were rumors that Russia had launched rockets and the Dow took a dive near the bell. I cleaned up my desk and raced to the Moosehead, as animated as only an 18 year-old can be. Jack was already there and as I burst through the door, I shouted: \u201cJack! Jack, there was a strong rumor that the missiles were flying and I tried to sell the market but failed.\u201d Jack said \u201cCalm down kid! First buy me a drink and then sit down and listen to me.\u201d I ordered the drink and meekly sat down. Jack said \u2013 \u201cLook kid, if you hear the missiles are flying, you buy them. You don\u2019t sell them.\u201d \u201cYou buy them?\u201d I said, somewhat puzzled. \u201cSure you buy them!\u201d said Jack. \u201cCause if you\u2019re wrong, the trade will never clear. We\u2019ll all be dead.\u201d That\u2019s a lesson you won\u2019t learn in the Wharton School.\u201d \u00a0 Art was one of a kind. He will be deeply missed. \u00a0 Sources:\nArt Cashin, New York Stock Exchange fixture for decades, dies at age 83\nBob Pisani\nCNBC, Dec 2 2024 Cashin on the Cuban Missile Crisis \/ North Korea (August 14, 2017) The World Is Ending?

Financial data platform 9fin has raised $50 million in new funding that\u2019s slated to be used to double down on its AI capabilities, hire more staff and accelerate its expansion into the U.S. The London-based fintech said Monday the capital was raised in a Series B round led by Highland Europe, a London-based VC firm focused on growth-stage startups. 9fin did not disclose the valuation at which the funds were raised. Last month, the Financial Times had reported that the startup was in talks for a deal that would give it a value in the region of $500 million. The startup raised $23 million in a previous funding round in December 2022 led by Spark Capital, a San Francisco-based VC firm that had previously invested in Twitter and Oculus. 9fin provides data and news for the debt markets through a subscription-based service. The company has invested heavily in technology that allows it to find and process data from a range of financial documents. It also employs reporters, lawyers and analysts to cover the news and provide insights into the credit markets. The platform\u2019s clients include executives from investment banks, distressed debt advisors, private equity, credit fund managers and law firms. \u201cDebt markets are booming but data and technology offerings simply haven\u2019t kept pace,\u201d Fergal Mullen, cofounder and partner at Highland Europe, said in a statement. \u201c9fin\u2019s vision, its relentless focus on technology, innovation and company culture, positions it as the go-to platform for those working in debt markets.\u201d 9fin\u2019s cofounder and CEO Steven Hunter said: \u201cDebt markets are the biggest overlooked asset class in the world and yet they still rely on technology and information sources straight out of the 1980s\u2014opaque, slow and messy.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a huge opportunity to build the number 1 global provider of debt market analytics, and bring debt markets into the AI age,\u201d he added. Hunter cofounded 9fin in 2016 with university classmate Huss El-Sheikh. Hunter had previously worked for Babson Capital Management and JP Morgan, whereas El-Sheikh had been an analyst with Deutsche Bank. In 2018, 9fin\u2019s cofounders were featured on the Forbes 30 Under 30 Europe list in recognition of their achievements as entrepreneurs in the finance industry. 9fin said its customer base had more than doubled over the past two years to nearly 200 firms, and it currently employs 240 people at its offices in London, Belfast and New York.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today. Review of Believe Nothing Until It Is Officially Denied: Claud Cockburn and the Invention of Guerrilla Journalism by Patrick Cockburn (Verso, 2024) Before Claud Cockburn first entered the Times of London premises in 1929, he had contributed to its Berlin bureau, which gave him some idea of what to expect. But even so, he thought it rather much that the first conversation he overheard was one editor translating Plato\u2019s Phaedo into Chinese, while his colleague recited the relevant passages in Greek from memory. Times editors, he recalled, were typically ensconced behind fat bookstacks, \u201cengaged in writing historical works of their own.\u201d It was at the desks of Britain\u2019s paper of record that C. K. Scott Moncrieff translated Proust, with the rest of the staff leaving their typewriters to help him find the right phrases \u2014 I guess it beat thumping out notices on municipal matters in, say, Cornwall. That\u2019s to say, the Times\u2019 editors were rather more interesting than their typical readers, who, like Ian Fleming\u2019s James Bond, were so soundly conformist they wouldn\u2019t read other papers but the Times. The best oppositional writers have often started their careers in establishment strongholds. As the legendary Times correspondent Willmott Lewis once told Claud, \u201cEvery government will do as much harm as it can and as much good as it must.\u201d That saying became one of Claud\u2019s mantras. It captured both his unsentimental view of politics and his sense of ironic humor \u2014 it\u2019s that combination that makes him, one of Britian\u2019s finest investigative reporters, worth revisiting a century later. Cockburn was no cynic. He believed that the press, if it were tough enough, could force the government to correct course. The seasoned foreign correspondent Patrick Cockburn writes in his biography of his father, Claud, Believe Nothing Until It Is Officially Denied, that he believed political leaders without \u201cfixity of purpose\u201d were \u201csensitive to pinprick criticism,\u201d so that with the right kind of pressure, they\u2019d \u201cprove more malleable than they pretended.\u201d Surveying the field today, the Cockburn thesis hasn\u2019t exactly been conspicuously confirmed. The political leaders in the United States persist in backing Israel\u2019s slaughter in Gaza, no matter what \u201cpinpricks\u201d they receive. Though President Joe Biden, of course, has nothing if not \u201cfixity of purpose\u201d when it comes to the killing of Palestinians. As he once put it to Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin, it wouldn\u2019t matter \u201cif all the civilians get killed.\u201d Patrick Cockburn notes in the introduction that pictures of bombed children in Gaza can now be instantly communicated to the rest of the world, but the established press itself is no less conformist than in Claud\u2019s time \u2014 it largely relies on official information even as it prides itself on being a \u201ccrusading profession.\u201d Seeing the Times from the inside forever cured Claud of that self-congratulatory notion. When he took over from Lewis in Washington, DC, Lewis proposed to the Times that he report on London with the same irreverent vigour that had made his American despatches so popular. That proposal, Claud noted, was rather coldly received. The mainline press, in other words, prefers consensus to confrontation. It is perhaps most evident by the intramural prizes, bestowed between colleagues who\u2019ve learned to compromise their principles \u2014 or still better, never had any. As Claud recalled, perhaps the worst thing that could happen to a Times employee was that they \u201cdeveloped \u2018views\u2019 on something or other \u2014 and in the Times language \u2018viewy\u2019 was a dreadfully damaging epithet.\u201d Not much more than two years after joining the Times, Claud, in the words of its brass, went \u201cred on us.\u201d Believe Nothing Until It Is Officially Denied takes its title from a Fleet Street saying that Claud popularized, having heard a senior representative of JP Morgan, on the day of the Great Crash of 1929, say everything would be fine in spite of \u201ca little distress selling on the stock exchange.\u201d Claud had a knack for being in the right place with the right people: he traveled to the occupied Ruhr with his schoolmate Graham Greene; he went to Oxford with his cousin Evelyn Waugh but spent his time outside term in-between Budapest and Berlin, where he learned politics rather more radical than that of the paneled rooms of Keble College; he met Al Capone in Chicago; he fled Hitler\u2019s thugs in Germany, but then returned to rescue the children of a comrade; and he fought Franco\u2019s forces in Spain, where he hung out with Arthur Koestler, met Ernest Hemingway, and helped W. H. Auden, who had traipsed through the countryside on a mule, reach Valencia by car. Biographers typically spend several hundred pages on their subject\u2019s childhood \u2014 sedulously listing obscure relatives \u2014 with even more on their senescence. It\u2019s thrilling stuff if you\u2019re the sort of person whose idea of a fun Saturday evening is to curl up in bed with a copy of the Maastricht Treaty. But Patrick Cockburn has pleasingly focused on the interwar period \u2014 the peak of Claud\u2019s contra-establishment campaign of \u201cguerrilla journalism.\u201d Claud left the Times in 1933, owing to how it suppressed news it thought overly hostile toward Adolf Hitler, to start his scrappy oppositional newsletter the Week. To resign on a point of principle, Patrick Cockburn observes, isn\u2019t precisely common; though colleagues praised him for it, \u201cfew followed his example.\u201d Claud launched the Week with minimal funds, relying on a humble mimeograph in an even humbler Victoria flat, in the hallway through which bustled lawyers threatening libel with police informants trying to uncover Claud\u2019s sources. British intelligence compiled a fat file on him, but it invariably concluded that suing would be too embarrassing. Perhaps they learned from Labour\u2019s first prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, who brandished a copy of the Week to the gathered correspondents at the London Economic Conference of 1933, claiming that no one should believe its pessimistic pronouncements. This alarmism was made hysterical by the fact that prior to the prime minister\u2019s intervention, the Week had only seven subscribers. Following it, as Claud noted, everyone from King Edward VIII to Charlie Chaplin read it, while Joachim von Ribbentrop \u201con two separate occasions demanded its suppression on the ground that it was the source of all anti-Nazi evil.\u201d Foreign correspondents that Claud had befriended in Central Europe supplied the Week with information they couldn\u2019t get into their own papers. They\u2019d meet at London\u2019s Caf\u00e9 Royal to share news, while Nazi spies competed with British intelligence for tables within earshot. Norman Ebbutt, Claud\u2019s erstwhile mentor, sent cables from Berlin on the Nazis that the Times wouldn\u2019t print; it meant the Week became Britain\u2019s perhaps most well-informed paper on Hitler\u2019s regime. Claud himself was uniquely placed to expose the so-called \u201cCliveden Set,\u201d the pro-appeasement clique that numbered the owner as well as the editor of the Times. Claud set himself in opposition to both Whitehall and Fleet Street. But that situation couldn\u2019t last forever. When Britain eventually sided with the Soviet Union, he realized that the moment the Week had exploited so fully had passed. He found himself on the side of official policy. Even though Claud belonged to the Communist Party, he was friends with several High Tories, like the novelist Anthony Powell and the satirist Malcolm Muggeridge. It might, I suppose, have helped that he came from the right kind of family; but still, he had none of the political puritanism one sometimes encounters on the Left: he knew how to be serious without being solemn. His friends sometimes inquired how he remained on such close terms with so many of the establishment right. He\u2019d reply that he measured people not by reassuringly conventional categories but by his own \u201cDreyfus test.\u201d As Patrick Cockburn puts it, Claud asked himself: If, hypothetically, a person had been in France during the affair, would they have protested in person and in print in favour of Dreyfus and against his persecutors? In other words, was their opposition to injustice an overriding feature of their character which took precedence over their other political sympathies? A sound enough test, to be sure, but perhaps Claud left himself open to the charge of hypocrisy. He had, one should recall, stuck with the Communist Party through the Stalinist show trials, even though in 1952 his friend Otto Katz went to the gallows in Prague, having confessed to being in the pay of the well-known British spy, Claud Cockburn. Shortly following his return from America, Claud began writing for the Daily Worker, which sent him to report on the war in Spain. Patrick is perhaps a shade too complimentary regarding Claud\u2019s Spanish pieces. Claud brilliantly illustrated the courage of the troops that battled Franco\u2019s far superior forces, but he evinced every mark of trying rather too hard to \u201cinspire\u201d \u2014 praising the frontline loyalists for their \u201cepic heroism,\u201d relaying the official line a little too faithfully to be truly convincing. In fact, George Orwell launched a minor polemic against \u201cFrank Pitcairn,\u201d Claud\u2019s nom de plume for the Daily Worker, claiming he had slandered the vaguely Trotsky-inflected POUM, or Workers\u2019 Party of Marxist Unification, to which Orwell belonged. It can\u2019t be said that Orwell was wrong. Historian Paul Preston rates him one of the least reliable foreign correspondents in Spain. But it\u2019s not just that he shaded the truth in his cables, they have none of his characteristic irony or stylistic verve. His book, Reporter in Spain, written on the orders of the British Communist Party, is far better than one might suppose, given that it was completed in one or two weeks\u2019 time; but nonetheless, some passages read like hammed-up lines from a mob play: \u201cvery swell,\u201d he has a waiter say of a Francoist \u201cbig shot.\u201d Patrick Cockburn says of the spat with Orwell that it ultimately mattered little. Orwell himself said that the \u201creal issue\u201d was the class war while the rest was mere \u201cfroth.\u201d For his part, Claud later remarked that he found it \u201cirksome to be endlessly proclaiming the imminence of victories which do not, in fact, occur.\u201d Still, he thought the Times\u2019 talk of being \u201cimpartial\u201d was sheer pablum. It seemed to me that a newspaper is always a weapon in somebody\u2019s hands, and I never could see why it should be shocking that the weapon should be used in what its owner conceived to be his best interest. The hired journalist, I thought, ought to realize that he is partly in the entertainment business \u2014 advertising either goods, or a cause, or a government. That, too, is sound enough \u2014 provided one emphasizes that supporting a cause isn\u2019t exactly the same as supporting a government. Besides, Claud thought it rather rich that the same types who pulled themselves up to their fullest stature to lecture him for penning propaganda themselves later boasted of having worked for the British wartime information services. A fair point, but it invites the rejoinder that much of what he wrote for the Daily Worker, like most official propaganda, isn\u2019t really worth reading today \u2014 except, of course, if one\u2019s reviewing it. But if it\u2019s safe to give the Spanish pieces a miss, his memoir, I, Claud, can still be read from cover to cover. By his personal example, he showed that oppositional journalism needn\u2019t be boring or sombre. But he showed, too, that there\u2019s a price: he was chased by debt collectors most of his life. Dissent isn\u2019t free. \u201cPersonal courage and resolution count for much,\u201d Patrick Cockburn concludes, \u201cas do a willingness to endure poverty and danger.\u201d Gustav J\u00f6nsson is an essayist and critic based in London. \n              {{ message }}\n             \n          Thanks for signing up! \u2192\n Already on our list?

The issuer's take on airport lounges, dubbed the Sapphire Lounge by The Club, first opened in the U.S. in Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) in 2023. The domestic network has since expanded to New York's LaGuardia Airport (LGA) and John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX), and Dulles International Airport (IAD), in addition to an international outpost in Hong Kong. On Friday, the issuer will take the wraps off its latest lounge \u2014 its seventh domestic outpost \u2014 at San Diego International Airport (SAN), making Chase the first credit card issuer to open a space at SAN. There's lots to love about this new outpost, so read on for everything you need to know. The Chase Sapphire Lounge by The Club at SAN is in Terminal 2 West between gates 46 and 47. The entrance is opposite Starbucks. All gates in Terminal 2 are connected airside, so as long as you're not flying on Frontier Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Southwest Airlines or Sun Country Airlines, you'll be good to enter the lounge before departure without reclearing security. (The aforementioned airlines operate from SAN's Terminal 1, which is only connected presecurity to Terminal 2.) Once you locate the entrance, you'll need to take an elevator or stairs up to the mezzanine level, where you'll find the frosted blue doors that mark the official entrance to the lounge. The space is open daily from 5 a.m. until 10 p.m. The access policies for the Chase Sapphire Lounge by The Club haven't changed with this opening. Primary and authorized cardmembers with the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae can enter the lounge for free, and they can bring up to two guests. Note that you'll need to have the (complimentary) Priority Pass associated with the card to enter the lounge. Additional guests beyond the initial allotment will be charged at $27 per person. The same access policy applies to those with the J.P. Morgan Reserve card or the Ritz-Carlton Credit Card (no longer available to new applicants), though the latter card includes unlimited guest access. Even if you don't have one of these cards, you might still be able to enter the Sapphire Lounge. Travelers with a Priority Pass membership (from any other premium credit card) can visit one Chase Sapphire Lounge per calendar year and purchase additional entries for themselves and guests for $75 per person. The information for the Ritz-Carlton Credit Card and JP Morgan Reserve Card has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer. Immediately after entering the new space, you'll see familiar color schemes and design elements that mimic the rest of the Sapphire Lounge network. From the colorful artwork to the wood flooring to the slatted room dividers, this space is unmistakably a Sapphire Lounge. That said, Chase certainly imbued a local flair into this space, with the lounge's focal artwork on display for everyone to see just after entering. This colorful surfboard-lined mural perfectly fits San Diego and establishes a sense of place for travelers passing through SAN. After entering the lounge, you'll walk straight past the reception desk into the dimly lit and moody main bar and dining areas. The wraparound bar is the largest one that Chase has built yet, and it's sure to be a popular gathering and socializing area once the lounge opens. There are a handful of bench-style dining tables lining the wall here. The main dining area features freestanding four-top tables. The room adjacent to the dining area \u2014 complete with an eye-catching lighting fixture \u2014 has even more tables for dining or relaxing. As you pass the main dining area, you can move in two directions. If you go straight to the back of the lounge, you'll find another large relaxation room outfitted with couches, recliners and a faux fireplace that acts as its centerpiece. Opposite this relaxation area are three productivity pods that are built directly into the wall \u2014 a cool touch for those who are trying to crank out some last-minute work. If you're taking calls, you'll want to make a beeline for the lounge's sole phone booth, located just next to the productivity pods. As you proceed farther into the lounge, you'll find the space's amenities \u2014 more on that below. If you instead go from the dining room and turn left to go back toward the lounge entrance, you'll find two more relaxation areas. The first is accented by a palm tree that serves as a fitting local touch. This open space is mostly outfitted with couches and comfy chairs to promote relaxation. Meanwhile, if you continue going straight to the back of the lounge, you'll find the \"Balboa breezeway,\" named after San Diego's Balboa Park. This room feels like a California-inspired home library, and this is where you'll find me posting up the next time I'm in the lounge. Interestingly, the Balboa breezeway can be partitioned off from the rest of the lounge by a sliding frosted glass door, though Chase doesn't intend to separate this space. Chase's first digital wall, which displays stunning drone footage of the San Diego coastline, is in the hallway connecting the rest of the lounge to the Balboa breezeway. All in all, this lounge is unmistakably Southern Californian. Better yet, the space will also be popular with aviation enthusiasts because the floor-to-ceiling windows that line the perimeter of the lounge provide unparalleled views of the apron and tarmac area. The space measures just over 10,000 square feet and has space for nearly 200 flyers. Though that may not be enough to handle peak demand, the partitioned design should make the lounge feel less crowded than it actually is. Though Chase's flagship outpost in LaGuardia might be the amenity king, this space could definitely be considered a mini-me of New York's finest. It starts with a wellness area located at the back of the lounge, which has four private relaxation pods. Each pod has access to digital meditations by Devi Brown. Meanwhile, there's a small facial bar with treatments from Face Haus located just across from the wellness area. The lounge also has a family room, which is filled with toys, games and books for younger travelers. There is also one shower in the lounge, and it's available on a first-come, first-served basis. Chase uses Apotheke products in all of its lounges. Meanwhile, there are separate men's and women's restrooms. The men's bathroom features three stalls, two urinals, a beautiful hand-washing area accented with gold sconces, and fantastic views of the tarmac and departing aircraft. In fact, this might be the prettiest restroom in the entire airport. Note that there is also a separate all-gender, accessible bathroom. There's also a separate nursing room that's available on a first-come, first-served basis. To reserve a facial, a wellness pod or the shower, you'll need to scan one of the QR codes that are displayed on each of the tables. From there, you'll be redirected to the lounge's landing page, where you can make your reservations (and even order a la carte dining). In addition to the aforementioned amenities, the lounge has the basics covered. Speedy Wi-Fi, power outlets, and USB-C and USB-A ports are located at nearly every seat. All of Chase's lounges have above-average dining options, and this location is no exception. The lounge offers a full breakfast buffet until 11 a.m., when it switches to all-day fare. From French crepes to hamburgers and parfait bowls to hummus and pita pockets, you'll likely find something appetizing on the buffet. If you're after more substantive food, you can also order items from the web-based portal. Chase is teaming up with San Diego's Oscar's Mexican Seafood on a handful of specialty dishes, such as a chicken tostada and potato soup with shrimp, which are available in addition to staples such as the Sapphire Burger. Also, the bar can whip up your favorite cocktail or pour one of the San Diego signatures, such as the bourbon- and gin-based Queen of Rum Row \u2014 all served for free. For those looking to hydrate, there are two large beverage stations, one near the buffet and another near the entrance by the surfboards. Both offer multiple types of water, coffee from California's Groundwork Coffee, espresso machines and minifridges stocked with popular soft drinks, such as Spindrift and Leisure Hydration's electrolyte drinks. With seven operational lounges in just over two years and three more already confirmed in the pipeline, Chase is making a big play for travelers to carry its top-of-the-line credit cards. The San Diego location will undoubtedly help attract even more cardmembers. The space itself is gorgeous, and it offers a slew of amenities and top-notch dining options that are sure to impress. Plus, the Southern California-inspired design helps give the space some local flair that will distinguish it from the existing outposts. As Chase continues to build more lounges, it raises the bar for what travelers can expect from a credit card-branded airport lounge. As the network grows, American Express and Capital One should take note because the Sapphire Lounges are, in some ways, even nicer than the Centurion Lounges and Capital One Lounges.

It also said it was neutral on other five Adani group bonds and was underweight on a bond issuance by Adani Green Energy.  In late November the US prosecutors, the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, separately indicted senior officials connected with Adani Green for alleged bribery in connection with solar energy contracts in India.  The US investment bank noted that the bonds issued by the group have gone through a period of liquidity after the news of the indictment, but the spreads have now settled. \u201cOverall, across key listed businesses of the group, we do not see any signs of stress.\u201d It pointed out that the group companies\u2019 liquidity needs seemed manageable with only Adani Green having $1.1 billion worth of bonds due in March 2025. The other entities with offshore debt are Adani Ports, Adani Airport Holdings and Ambuja Cement.  In the case of Adani Ports, which has about 82 per cent offshore debt, JP Morgan observed that most of its debt was unsecured. In terms of security it had the least share of secured debt with about 77 per cent of the total debt as of FY24 being unsecured.  In the near term Adani Ports has upcoming offshore debt repayments coming up in January to the extent of $290 million. Ambuja Cement has $300 million coming up in March next, while Adani Airport Holdings has $250 million coming up in May 2025 and $150 million in September 2025.  With reference to the concerns raised by investors on the unsecured nature of Adani Ports\u2019 offshore debt, JP Morgan said that it favoured cash flows over security largely. It said that decent distribution is allowed under covenants and cash cannot be treated entirely as trapped while it had comfort from the fact that Adani Ports had the ability to scale and grow using internal cash flows.  The upcoming payment of Adani Ports in January is backed by a pledge of Haifa Port and JP Morgan said that the loans would be refinanced by local banks or financial institutions in Israel.  Bonds issued by other Adani group are secured and have covenants including cash flow waterfall mechanism, distributions linked to graded debt service coverage ratio, which offer protection from cash leakage out of project companies, it said.  \n\t\tComments\n\t\t BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

These include massive changes in the cloud infrastructure landscape with investment of hundreds of billions of dollars in an AI infrastructure arms race, as well as the struggle of enterprises to find return on investment in AI. This week, both of these trends had interesting twists. The week started off with the resignation of Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, demonstrating what happens when you miss a huge market shift. Intel, even before Gelsinger took over, was poorly positioned in graphics processing units, the area that NVIDIA pioneered. But Gelsinger perhaps made things worse by focusing on an approach favoring the buildout of domestic and European manufacturing facilities and a foundry business, all based in part on government funding. AWS had plenty of announcements in hardware to demonstrate that it will stay in front of the AI arms race, including ensuring its supply of chips. In addition to buying chips from AI compute leaders NVIDIA and AMD, AWS has its own line of chips, including Graviton and Trainium. Here at re:Invent, it unveiled mass-scale AI clusters, complete with its own networking and interconnect technology, as well as general availability of its Trainium2 AI training chip. LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - DECEMBER 3: Amazon Web Services (AWS) CEO Matt Garman delivers a keynote address ... [+] during AWS re:Invent 2024, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian Las Vegas on December 3, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Noah Berger\/Getty Images for Amazon Web Services) On the enterprise ROI front, I saw several examples of this in the re:Invent keynotes as well as the analyst conference, where companies as diverse as Apple, JP Morgan, The Hartford, Novo Nordisk, and others demonstrated how they are using AI to gain ROI in specific use cases. Let\u2019s dive into these two areas in more detail. Walking around the re:Invent conference, which hosted 60,000 people, you can talk to anybody from cloud engineers to Fortune 500 CEOs. The conference is of course owned and operated by AWS, so it\u2019s an annual tradition for AWS to launch a barrage of technology announcements\u2014literally hundreds\u2014that demonstrate why it\u2019s still the leading cloud operator. The question is, will AI help or hurt AWS in the long run? In addition to AWS competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, the AI boom has spawned a raft of AI-focused cloud providers, including Lambda and CoreWeave, the latter of which has achieved a valuation of tens of billions of dollars in just a few years. AWS is of course determined not to let AI derail its leadership. Its announcements range from huge hardware projects to feature upgrades of its AI services SageMaker and Bedrock. On the hardware front, AWS showed it has a diversification strategy to provide its own hardware, even though it buys from many suppliers, including NVIDIA. AWS announced general availability of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) on Trn2 instances, which feature clusters of 16 Trn2 chips. And Trn2 can be scaled up using hardware clustering solutions. A separate Trn2 UltraServer, now in preview, features a cluster of 64 Trn2 chips across four Trn2 instances. AWS CEO Matt Garman positioned it as a broadening of the market rather than as a competitive alternative to NVIDIA. \"NVIDIA is an incredibly important partner of ours. AMD is an incredible partner as well. Today it is true that the vast majority of workloads run on NVIDIA. We're so early where GenAI can be, that I think Trainium increases the size of the pie. It's not going to be at the expense [of others].\"  The company is also planning a massive supercomputer named Project Rainier in partnership with Anthropic (which AWS has invested in), based on UltraServers. It's set to debut in 2025. Anthropic isn\u2019t alone. Other Trn2 customers include Databricks, Datadog, Ricoh, Hugging Face, and PyTorch. It wouldn\u2019t be re:Invent without lots of geeky upgrades to AWS services. AWS has rebranded its SageMaker ML service as SageMaker AI, which sports a bunch of enhancements designed to grease the wheels of ML-based analytics. These include the SageMaker HyperPod, which coordinates modeling workloads. In a keynote talk at the conference this week, Swami Sivasubramanian, VP of AI and data at AWS, outlined a raft of new services that streamline model training and inferencing for enterprise customers. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the convergence of big data, analytics, machine learning, and generative AI,\u201d said Sivasubramanian. And AWS has built on a range of past successes to meet demand, he said. In another example, the company\u2019s other AI service, Bedrock, offers a range of large language models. This year features multi-agent collaboration, which allows agents to coordinate across different tasks. Example: For a financial services firm, according to AWS\u2019s online announcement, \u201cspecialized agents could coordinate to gather data, analyze trends, and provide actionable recommendations\u2014working in parallel to improve response times and precision.\u201d This feature is currently available in the US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), and Europe (Ireland) AWS Regions. Queue up the next topic: enterprise AI. The world is filled with chatter about whether AI can fulfill its promise in delivering ROI to the enterprise. There are of course many skeptics, including Render founder and CEO Anurag Goel, who was also a former executive at Stripe. Render has a cloud automation platform that Goel says is being adopted by \u201chundreds of thousands of developers per month.\u201d He told me that he hadn\u2019t seen a huge demonstration of ROI at the conference. \u201cAWS announced a lot of services around AI but they lack a coherent end-to-end theme,\u201d Goel told me in the hallway of the Venetian. \u201cThe business value and the ROI remains unclear.\u201d Despite some skepticism about the AI endgame, some attendees said there has been a shift in thinking from \u201cgod\u201d products to more tactical technology using AI. Adam Jacob, cofounder and CEO of System Initiative, told me the new thinking embodies a more tactical, focused approach he refers to as \u201cmicro AI.\u201d \u201cAs an industry, we started out by thinking, \u2018We're going to have a single god robot that we just pump all the exabytes of data to and we just let the god machine sort it out.\u2019 We're learning that that creates a terrible user experience and is incredibly hard to track and secure. Instead, we're starting to build micro AI experiences that form a series of small experiences that build up to really compelling big ones.\" The case for micro AI makes sense. Generalized AI is difficult and has key challenges such as accuracy, data security, and data provenance. But if you can focus on specific solutions with an AI tool, you might have a better shot at ROI gratification. In its analyst conference, AWS did a good job of presenting ROI examples from customers, which was a noticeable change from last year, when the market was still riding the pink cloud of AI hype. In its briefing sessions for industry analysts, AWS had examples of compelling ROI-driven case studies. Companies presenting included Apple, JP Morgan, The Hartford, Merck, New York Life, and Novo Nordisk, among others. Louise Lind Skov, head of content digitalisation with Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk. showed how the company reduced the time to create regulatory documentation from two months to several minutes by building its own AI-driven tool on AWS, which it calls NovoScribe. \u201cFrom a medical writing perspective, this would have required thousands of hours of work,\u201d said Skov. NovoScribe seems to be a great example of micro AI. By focusing on a specific use case and process, Novo Nordisk was able to deliver specific efficiencies. This will be a big theme going forward as the AI wave takes a circuitous path to technology nirvana. Nobody has a god AI app yet, but there are certainly many tools available to solve everyday problems and deliver tangible results in focused areas.  One Community.

You can buy at the bottom of an asset\u2019s range because no one else wants to. You can sell at the top because everyone wants to buy when it is the top of the market. When prices rise higher than what the text books say, more people want to buy so the upward trend continues and likewise when prices fall most people want to sell to avoid further pain. The trouble becomes when you hit the bottom, everyone who wants to sell has already sold, so the rare buyers sweep up the crumbs and any further buyers have to pay more. Likewise at the top everyone has bought and are singing how it's going to the moon, only for the market to have run out of further buyers. As such a solitary seller will knock the price and pretty soon not only are there no more buyers but everyone starts sweating and looking to sell. The classic crash follows. We are now approaching the top of crypto. While some say there is no top to bitcoin, most would agree there is and where that top is, is now the key call. During the previous crash the bottom was the call. I called $13,000, but it was around $18,000. Now we are at $100,000; what\u2019s the call? Is this the top (probably not); is it $110,000-$120,000 (seems sensible); is it $150,000 (not impossible); $200,000, $500,000, $1,000,000 (good luck friend). The thing to remember is the 5x is gone and we are now looking at +20%-+50%. While this is not a shoddy return, the drop from the top is probably 50% so we are now solidly in risk management territory. The way to go at the bottom is to dollar cost average in and the way to get out is the same in reverse. Buy over time when you think the bottom is near and sell out over time when you think the top is in the vicinity. That is my strategy and for me $100,000 is the gateway to the top. With a top you can leave early or leave late, either way the outcome is the same, but leave you must. So what to do: 1. True believers will stay and simply not care if the price halves because in their creed it will 10x soon enough, so why bother trying to trade it when you can just hold and perhaps even buy more at the next bottom. 2. Investors who bought near the previous bottom will be looking for the exit and trying to define the top to maximize their profits. 3. Traders should look to the most explosive end of the market in chains like Solana and Base and track today\u2019s crazy token to ride up the final leg of the bitcoin rally. They still have multiples in them but those will come and go in weeks or even days giving traders exactly what they live for, incredible volatility. And finally\u2026 4. For those that wake up at 3 a.m. to check the bitcoin price, they should sell down a bit every 3 a.m. they wake up until they can sleep. Here is the chart: The current bitcoin chart as it breaks through the $100,000 barrier And here is the projection: My projection of where bitcoin could go You will see this projection in my many previous articles here going back a very long time indeed. Here is one from an article last December: How I predicted the bitcoin price a year ago  Not a bad call for a year out! Here is another from April of this year: My April 2024 prediction for bitcoin One from a month ago: Last month's bitcoin prediction Of course I could be wrong, but it seems clear to me we are now dealing with percentages rather than multiples in the upside for bitcoin. The mainstream is in process of FOMO-ing in and that is the signal to make plans for the exit. Remember you have not won until you leave the casino with more than you came with, and bear in mind JP Morgan who said, \u2018I made a fortune selling too early,\u2019 and don\u2019t forget when wracked with FOMO, there is always another bus coming.

When residents of Dubuque, Iowa, saw the Dupaco Voices Building under renovation, they saw more than a beautiful building. For some, they saw a chance to transform their families\u2019 futures. The project is expected to create 150 jobs and office and commercial space for local businesses. It was made possible in part by the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program, a federal program established in 2000 to stimulate economic growth and job creation by directing private investment to underserved urban and rural communities. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to see firsthand how the NMTC program has helped spur growth in hundreds of communities across the country. It funds a diverse range of projects, including manufacturing facilities, healthcare centers, educational institutions and community service organizations, all aimed at revitalizing underserved areas. The program is a shining example of what is possible through public-private collaboration and a shared goal of impact. One of the most powerful effects of the NMTC program is the creation of good-paying, quality jobs, which is a cornerstone of economic growth and the long-term stability of our communities. Unfortunately, job opportunities and choices are not created equal in the U.S. and largely depend on where you live. Leveling this playing field and giving people more opportunities for full-time employment is essential to help families build wealth and achieve upward mobility. The NMTC program enables businesses to expand and hire more workers in urban and rural communities alike. What\u2019s more, the breadth of different projects financed by NMTC results in job creation across a variety of fields\u2014bringing opportunities to healthcare providers, daycare and primary school teachers, factory workers and more. More opportunity and choice is good for everyone. According to the CDFI Fund, from 2000 through 2023, the NMTC program has resulted in \u201cthe creation or retention of more than 894,000 jobs\u201d for the American people. This includes nearly 60,000 in 2023 alone, more than half of which were full-time, permanent roles. NMTC projects like the Dupaco Voices Building are a prime example of how the program can have a ripple effect on communities. Dubuque\u2019s historic Millwork District has been undergoing revitalization for nearly 15 years, with focuses on business retention and expansion, workforce solutions and sustainable innovations. JPMorgan Chase provided nearly $8.4 million in NMTC and Historic Tax Credit equity investments to support the renovation of the building. The renovation will retain some of the city\u2019s heritage while creating a new home for Dupaco Community Credit Union and is expected to create 150 jobs. It also includes space for other businesses to operate, adding to the vibrancy of the district. This is the essence of the NMTC program: to drive investment, opportunity and industry far beyond the project itself. One study found that an NMTC-funded project could spur an average of 18 new firms to enter a community. We\u2019ve seen this play out time and time again in cities and towns all across the country. As is true with any policy, partnership is essential to the success of the NMTC program. Fundamentally, the program works by attracting private investment from financial institutions and intermediaries such as regional or local community development financial institutions (CDFIs) or community development entities (CDEs). As I highlighted in my last article on CDFIs, these institutions bring decades of local expertise and relationships to these transactions. They help ensure that investments are directed toward initiatives that will have the most significant impact, and they are vital to maximizing the benefits of the NMTC program. The NMTC program is more than just a financial tool; it is a powerful engine for economic growth and job creation. By supporting projects like the Dupaco Voices Building, we can unlock new opportunities and build a brighter future for communities across the nation.

Planning,opportunity, ... [+] challenge and business strategy. New Goals, Plans and Visions for Next Year 2025 It\u2019s a tradition unlike any other! Move over, Masters. In these contrarian pages we select one dividend stock (or fund) for the year ahead. Last year we bet on a \u201csafe, somewhat-secret\u201d 7.4% dividend from Jamie Dimon & Co with iShares JP Morgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF (EMB). EMB\u2019s payout plus price gains combined for a 12% total return. Nice. This is exactly what we look for as income investors. A high-yield investment that will pay us our divvies\u2014and gain a bit in price. But this year we are flipping the script. My favorite divvie stock for next year is a growth play with a lot of upside but only a modest 2.2% current yield. (Recent 67% dividend growth more than compensates!) For those who need income now, read on. My two \u201crunner up\u201d dividends yield 8.9% and 6.6%. Not a bad way to round out the medal podium. Let\u2019s start with a play on stubbornly high mortgage rates. They are back above 7.4%\u2014yikes for homebuyers, but bullish for our old Contrarian Income Report friend Rithm Capital (RITM). Why? Because RITM is sitting on a stockpile of mortgage service rights (MSRs), which gain in value as rates grind sideways or up. MSRs are contracts that give the holder the right to collect payments from a borrower. These aren\u2019t the loans themselves; they are the rights to service these loans. A subtle but important difference. When I bought my first house, my bank flipped the servicing of my loan to a firm called Caliber Home Loans. Caliber collected our monthly payment and settled up with the lender. We made our payments on time, so this was easy money for Caliber. Yes, our recent refi disrupted their smooth servicing process, but as rates continue to rise, Caliber will see fewer loans \u201ccalled away\u201d and paid early. Ironically, RITM has purchased Caliber! Recently we booked profits on RITM in CIR because it appeared the mortgage market would come back to life. It\u2019s time, however, to reverse our previous diagnosis\u2014the housing market is dead as a doornail. This is too bad for homebuyers, but it is fantastic news for MSR mega-long RITM, which yields an elite 8.9%. This stock is an interesting buy again here, perhaps more as a trade than a buy and hold given the likely volatility in the bond market. Next up is a cheap energy stock. Wait, what? I\u2019ve already heard from careful readers concerned that Trump \u201cdrilled so much first term, he tanked oil.\u201d It\u2019s true that energy prices slid all four Trump years, but the bear market in oil started in 2014\u2014two years before Trump 1.0. It was triggered by the massive supply from the US shale boom. So, by the time Trump was inaugurated in 2017, these trends were already in motion. I would not draw many conclusions from previous energy stock returns. The biggest bargain on the energy board today is BP PLC (BP), the British behemoth. BP has been around forever (more than a century) and like the old British Empire the sun never sets on BP\u2019s 61-country operation. BP produces crude oil and natural gas; deals in wind power and hydrogen and carbon capture; owns thousands of miles of pipelines; has commercial operations such as convenience and retail fuel stations, Castrol lubricants and EV charging; trades oil, gas, and renewable and non-renewable power; and even has a bioenergy business. BP cut its dividend by 50% in 2020 and shares, pulled lower by their \u201cdividend magnet,\u201d were chopped in half. Since then, though, the giant has recovered. Sales doubled between 2020 and 2023, and the firm is solidly profitable again. The \u201cpayout penance\u201d continues for BP, with four hikes on the books since its infamous cut. This reminds us, once again, that CFOs are like carpenters\u2014they measure twice and cut the dividend just once if they can help it. So far, so good. BP\u2019s dividend sits 50% higher than after the cut, still off its peak but trending positively. BP Price\/Dividend Chart Yet income scars (and memories of them) are slow to heal. BP trades for only 8-times earnings and less than half of its trailing sales. Contrast BP with CIR alum Exxon Mobil (XOM) which trades for 15-times earnings and 1.5-times sales. This sad pup will soon be readopted by income-hungry investors. The company recently completed a $3.5 billion share repurchase program and initiated a new one, which it says it will complete by year end, removing another 4% of the energy giant\u2019s float! But my favorite play for 2025 is a bet on the cheapest asset on the board right now\u2014agriculture. Grains spiked in the spring of 2022 when Russia invaded major wheat exporter Ukraine, but they have trended lower since because global farmers have boosted supply: Corn and wheat are mired in a decade-long bear market. But they are not going to stay cheap because they never do. Current low prices will cure themselves because farmers will plant less corn and wheat in favor of something more profitable, such as cotton: 10yr Crop Returns Which means one of the surest bets we can make over the coming years is that the downtrends of corn and wheat will reverse. In fact, these two grains will likely spike at some point as supply diminishes and demand remains steady. This is what always happens with commodities. Corn and wheat are as cyclical as it gets. And fertilizer makers like CF Industries (CF) will benefit handsomely from the upcoming rally in grain prices. CF is already forecasting strong global pricing for its nitrogen fertilizers. The company forecasts that fertilizer demand will outpace supply over the next four years. The turnaround is already reflected in CF\u2019s generous dividend hikes\u201467% combined over the past two years! Wall Street is beginning to sniff this story out. CF shares rose 9.7% in November. This could be the start of a major upside move. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

[+] the strings attached make producing affordable housing more expensive. I\u2019ve said it many times: Housing built using Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) are incredibly expensive, inefficient, and take a long time to build. And when they are completed, they never meet housing needs, ending up with endless waiting lists with many income and other requirements for potential residents to meet. In California, the cost for a LIHTC unit of housing in California has reached $1,000,000 per unit, a figure that dwarfs the costs of just buying a single-family home or even older apartment buildings. One of the problems is that non-profit developers engage in what is typically called \u201ccapital stacking,\u201d the practice of seeking many sources of funding for these projects. This practice makes the problem of costs worse. I want to start with some testimony back in September, when Senator Patty Murray, Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee convened a hearing about the affordable housing \u201ccrisis.\u201d One of the panelists was Greta Harris, the Chief Executive Officer of the Better Housing Coalition (BHC), a Virginia non-profit housing developer. The organization\u2019s mission statement says it \u201ccreates high-quality homes for residents of modest means and empowers them with programs and tools to help them reach their fullest potential, at all stages of life.\u201d You can watch the whole video here. Ms. Harris\u2019 testimony quoted below begins at the 3-minute mark. The transcript from You Tube is lightly edited. \u201cMs. Harris: Mr. Williams is correct. The Low Income Housing Tax Credit [LIHTC] program has been extremely effective in allowing us to produce more housing units and preserve existing affordable housing units. The cost of a unit of housing, whether it is market rate or affordable, is almost identical. The only way that we are able to offer rents at 50%, 60%, 70% off of market rate is the capital stack that we use by holding our debt own to about 30% of the overall development costs versus the market rate development that is somewhere between 70% and 90%. The Low Income Housing Tax equity allows us to do that. Then, there is usually 15% to 20% left of gap financing that is needed. We have used creative things like capital magnet funds from the CDFI [Community Development Financial Institution] fund and in some cases philanthropy to be able to fill those holes and deliver quality housing options for families. The one thing I would say, is while we are cobbling together sometimes 12, 14 sources of financing, that adds another 12 to 24 months to the delivery time. And the demand is so high that every time we open a new community, we have four, five times the applications we have units to help families find quality housing.\u201d Now, I\u2019m not picking on Ms. Harris. Many people have been housed by her organization, and I am certain that many lives have been changed for the better by their work in Virginia. But her earnest statement about \u201ccapital stacking\u201d betray the gross inefficiency of how these projects are put together. What is capital stacking? Well, in for profit, market rate projects it refers to the different kinds of debt on a development project, with the bottom of the stack being the \u201csenior\u201d debt or the debt that has to be retired first. The JP Morgan site has a good rundown of the different kinds of debt in a market rate project. But for these non-profit, LIHTC projects, \u201ccapital stacking\u201d means different sources of funding, not necessarily debt as Ms. Harris points out in her comments. A report from 2017 from a group in Washington State I watched closely back in 2017, Housing Affordability Response Team found this about stacking various sources of capital in a project and identified it as a barrier in their report and recommendations to Governor Jay Inslee. \u201c\u2018Capital Stacking.\u2019 Affordable housing projects have additional layers of complexity in the areas of financing, construction, and regulatory control. In order to finance an affordable housing project, developers typically have to compile a \u201ccapital stack\u201d of funding. It is common for up to five funding sources to be required to finance each project. The stack of funds means that there are layers of restrictions requiring specialized expertise to manage, as well.\u201d The more sources of funding, the more requirements, the higher the costs, and as Ms. Harris points out, adding \u201canother 12 to 24 months to the delivery time.\u201d More recently, Berkeley\u2019s Terner Center, in a report called, \u201cThe Complexity of Financing Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Housing in the United States,\u201d found that, \u201cthe multiple sources of financing that LIHTC properties often require to make the math work can impose inefficiencies that add to a development\u2019s total costs in both direct and indirect ways.\u201d Also, as I\u2019ve said before, \u201cthe costs of financing complexity are difficult to quantify because detailed, consistent, and comprehensive data on the costs of LIHTC developments are not publicly available, and costs associated with identifying and layering funding sources are often not explicitly tracked.\u201d Even though Ms. Harris is telling this august Senate Committee this information in such a matter-of-fact way, nobody in congress seems alarmed or concerned or even motivated to address this problem. It\u2019s obvious why they should: the higher the costs, the fewer units built, the fewer people helped. The answer is just, more money, more money, more money. A solution Ms. Harris, the HART committee, and the Terner Center all say makes the problem of costs worse! One last thing, market rate housing is does not cost the same as housing financed using multiple sources of government capital. And the example I\u2019m going to give here makes the point that has already been made, housing financed with multiple sources of capital is too expensive. Take a 50 unit apartment building in Inglewood, California being marketed for $13,153,350 or $267,800 per unit. Consider that by some estimates, apartments in the United States cost, on average about $350 per square foot. That math checks out; the Inglewood apartment for sale is 37,581 square feet, or $356 per square foot. Compare that to a recent project in Inglewood called the Sankofa Place at Centinela which will build 120 units at a total cost of $93 million, or $775,000 per unit. There are numerous sources of funding for the project ranging from $5 million to $43 million and it includes, grants, loans, and bond funding. State and local government are pouring incredible amounts of money into these projects, including LIHTC equity. They are not the same cost as market rate housing. But my point in making the comparison is that there are better options than assembling capital like buying older buildings, excluding complex financing structures, and focusing on using local funds rather than an array of federal and other funding with numerous strings. More money isn\u2019t the answer; more housing is."},{"source":"CNA","author":null,"title":"MAS hands JPMorgan S$2.4 million civil penalty over misconduct by its relationship managers","description":"SINGAPORE: The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has handed JPMorgan Chase Bank a S$2.4 million (US$1.78 million) civil penalty for failing to prevent and detect misconduct by its relationship managers in Singapore.

The bank's relationship managers had made inaccurate or incomplete disclosures for 24 over-the-counter (OTC) bond transactions to its clients, resulting in them being charged spreads \"above the bilaterally agreed rates\", MAS said in a press release on Monday (Dec 2). The move follows MAS' review of pricing and disclosure practices in the private banking industry, the authority said. Investigations found that for OTC bond transactions, JPMorgan's practice was to charge its clients a spread over the interbank prices, MAS said. \"As the interbank prices were not available to clients, they had to rely on the relationship managers' representations to them regarding the interbank prices and spreads,\" it added.\u00a0 The authority said that the bank did not establish adequate processes and controls to ensure that its relationship managers adhered to pre-agreed spreads with clients when executing OTC bond transactions on their behalf.\u00a0 MAS said it sampled OTC bond transactions conducted by the bank's relationship managers and found that in the 24 transactions, they\u00a0had either misrepresented the executed interbank prices or spread charged, or omitted information that the spreads charged were above the agreed rates. This contravenes the\u00a0Securities and Futures Act, the authority said. The 24 transactions took place between November 2018 and September 2019. JPMorgan Chase Bank has admitted liability over the misconduct by its relationship managers, paid MAS the civil penalty, and refunded the overcharged fees to its affected clients, the authority said.\u00a0 It has also enhanced its pricing frameworks and internal controls to prevent the recurrence of such misconduct, it added. In response to queries from CNA, JPMorgan said: \"As part of an industry-wide thematic inspection, JP Morgan Private Bank participated in a review that found certain deficiencies in past pricing and disclosure practices.\" In 2020, after completing an internal review,\u00a0JP Morgan Private Bank fully reimbursed clients affected by the misconduct, the bank said, adding that the transactions represented \"a very small portion of the total trades processed during the related period\". It also \"undertook a comprehensive update to its internal controls, monitoring and training framework\" to ensure that its trade governance, pricing transparency and compliance principles would continue to be upheld, it said. \"We are pleased to have this matter resolved and remain dedicated to delivering an exceptional experience for our clients,\" JPMorgan said. A civil penalty action is not a criminal action and does not attract criminal sanctions. The civil penalty regime, which MAS said was designed to complement criminal sanctions and provide a nuanced approach to combat market misconduct, became operational at the start of 2004.

The collective market capitalization of 14 Bitcoin miners tracked by JP Morgan increased a \u201cstaggering\u201d 52% month-over-month to $36.2 billion, the note stated. Among November\u2019s best performers, analysts noted that Singapore-based Bitdeer\u2019s stock surged 83% to $14.27 during the period. This year, Bitcoin miners have faced notable headwinds alongside Bitcoin\u2019s fourth halving. The pre-programmed, quadrennial event, which reduced Bitcoin\u2019s per-block reward to 3.125 BTC (about $299,000 worth as of this writing) in April, has tested the efficiency of firms\u2019 mining fleets, as their margins have been stretched thin. According to JP Morgan analysts, mining revenues have declined 50% following April\u2019s halving, as Bitcoin\u2019s per-block rewards were slashed from 6.25 BTC (about $598,000 worth today). While still comparatively low, analysts wrote that Bitcoin\u2019s rising price\u2014currently about $95,680\u2014made it more lucrative to mine Bitcoin in November. Looking broadly at miners\u2019 daily revenue in Bitcoin based on one exahash of mining capacity, revenue increased 24% in November to $52,000 from around $42,000 in October. Also referred to as EH, exahash represents a unit of measurement capturing the speed at which Bitcoin miners are guessing a random number needed to earn Bitcoin\u2019s next block reward. Last month, Bitdeer disclosed a $50 million loss in the third quarter, citing the halving\u2019s impact on its bottom line. At the same time, the company said it made \u201csubstantial progress\u201d on commercializing its line of Bitcoin mining chips set to compete with Bitmain\u2019s popular products. By November\u2019s end, Bitcoin\u2019s price increased to $97,000 following Donald Trump\u2019s election win, notching 132% in gains year-to-date. However, the report stated that the only Bitcoin miner to outpace Bitcoin in terms of stock price gains was TeraWulf, with its stock price increasing 229% to $7.89 so far this year. TeraWulf\u2019s was able to hold on to its industry-leading jump despite disappointing third-quarter earnings. The company disclosed a loss of $0.06 per share in the three-months ended September, coming in 75% below expectations of a $0.04 loss, per Google Finance. Overall, publicly traded Bitcoin miners saw a post-election increase in stock price last month. Of the 14 firms tracked by JP Morgan, Argo Blockchain was the only miner to end November in the red, with its stock price falling 3% over the month to $1.08 on Friday. Still, less than a handful of miners outpaced Bitcoin\u2019s 39% climb in November, which represented the asset\u2019s second best month this year in terms of gains, according to CoinGlass data. The JP Morgan report highlighted Bitdeer, Hut 8, MARA Holdings, and Iris Energy as four firms that were able to surpass Bitcoin\u2019s gains during the period. Notably, MARA Holdings increased its Bitcoin holdings in November, padding its lead as the second largest corporate holder of Bitcoin behind MicroStrategy. According to Bitcoin Treasuries, the firm purchased around 7,200 BTC last month that\u2019s currently worth $700 million. With a market cap of $8.8 billion by November's end, MARA stood as the most valuable Bitcoin miner. And the company announced Monday that it had added onto its $3.3 billion Bitcoin stash, purchasing another 6,484 Bitcoin worth $618 million, as of this writing.

(File) Adani Group companies' liquidity needs seem stable after tabulating the near-term maturities for offshore debt, said JP Morgan. Adani Green bond issue - which has a decent-size loan of over a billion dollars - will be in focus, it added. The brokerage said Adani Group bonds have gone through a period of volatility after the US indictments of some management and board members linked to Adani Green. The spreads of the bonds seem to have settled since and widened by 100-200 bps, it said, adding that short-tenor bonds spreads widened more due to high dollar prices. JP Morgan has also rated four Adani Group bonds as 'overweight', three of which are by Adani Ports and SEZ and another by Adani Electricity. JP Morgan has also taken a neutral stand on five other Adani bonds and is underweight on only one issued by Adani Green.\u00a0\"The ability to scale and grow using internal cash flows in the case of Adani Ports gives us strong comfort,\" said JP Morgan.  The 'overweight' rating falls in the buy rating category, as per JP Morgan. The US investment firm also gives two other ratings - 'neutral', which falls in hold category, and 'underweight', which falls in the sell category. Adani Bonds could do well than anticipated if there was a quick resolution of the US charges, successful refinancing of the upcoming bonds and credit facilities, and an improved operating performance, said the brokerage. PromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com Adani Group has rejected the charges by US authorities and asserted that chairman Gautam Adani, his nephew and Adani Green executive director Sagar Adani, and Chief Executive Officer Vneet Jaain have not been named in bribery charges. \"Every attack makes us stronger and every obstacle becomes a stepping stone for a more resilient Adani Group,\" Chairman Gautam Adani said at a recent event.

Thanks for visiting! No matter the economic climate, you can always bet on sports fans to show up for their favorite teams. This partially explains why sports investment banking has become a hot field, with JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs launching their own sports coverage groups. For a long time, sports teams and franchises were not worth that much, so banks rarely put their \u201cA-Teams\u201d on these deals. But this started changing in the 2010s and early 2020s as team values skyrocketed and billionaires, sovereign wealth funds, and sports private equity firms all jumped into the sector. We\u2019ll do a full breakdown of the sector here, but as usual, we need to start with the definitions, trends, and drivers: Sports Investment Banking Definition: In sports IB, bankers advise on equity and debt issuances, mergers, acquisitions, and restructuring deals for sports teams and leagues, sports-adjacent technology and services firms, and facilities such as arenas, stadiums, and racetracks. I am using the same breakout that Inner Circle uses for its deals: Teams & Leagues, Technology & Services, and Facilities. Like renewables, sports is a combination of other sectors: As a result of these divisions, it\u2019s difficult to \u201cclassify\u201d sports IB teams. Traditionally, teams in all these industry groups have covered sports, but we will probably see more dedicated coverage at the large banks. Sports investment banking is not particularly specialized, so you don\u2019t get extra points for having \u201cindustry experience\u201d in the same way you might in an oil & gas, mining, or financial institutions group. Also, it might be the only field where it\u2019s 100x harder to get \u201cindustry experience\u201d than to get into IB (good luck becoming an Olympic athlete or a professional footballer). It does help to have industry experience in one of the related sectors (tech\/TMT, real estate, infrastructure, public finance, etc.), and most people are better served by working in one of these first. Beyond that experience, bankers look for the same qualities as always: High grades, a good university or business school, previous finance internships, and networking and interview prep. Be prepared to discuss a recent sports deal (ideally involving a team or league) and have a rough idea of the trends, drivers, and valuation differences (see below). If you win a job offer, your experience as an Analyst or Associate depends 100% on your vertical focus. However, one common point across all the verticals is that IPOs are not common because there aren\u2019t that many publicly traded sports teams, stadiums, or arenas. SPAC IPOs for esports companies were \u201chot\u201d for a short period in 2021, but they seem to have died off by now. Therefore, expect more debt deals for stadiums and arenas and more M&A deals, spin-offs, divestitures, minority stake purchases, and JV deals for teams and leagues. Traditional leveraged buyouts are also less common due to restrictions on ownership percentages and financing in many leagues. You will probably get the most \u201cbalanced\u201d experience in the technology & services vertical, but it will be similar to the standard TMT experience. Sports is unique because a mix of local, regulatory, and macro factors drives it: It\u2019s difficult to find \u201cpublic companies\u201d in these verticals because most teams, leagues, and stadiums are privately owned or owned via public\/private partnerships. Many leagues restrict ownership of teams to a certain number of people, which means that going public may not be an option. This explains why Inner Circle has a separate \u201cLimited Partnership Transactions\u201d group. All that said, we\u2019ve attempted to find at least a few relevant companies and documents in each vertical: Representative Public Companies: Manchester United, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus FC, Madison Square Garden Sports (they own the New York Knicks and New York Rangers), Liberty Media Corporation, the Atlanta Braves, and Rogers Communications (owner of the Maple Leafs, Raptors, Toronto FC, and 20% of the Blue Jays). A few smaller European football clubs also happen to be publicly traded (Ajax, Celtic, etc.). The key metrics here include the number of games\/events each season, the average attendance per game, the average ticket prices, the terms of broadcasting\/streaming contracts, and the average player contract value and length. Financial analysis comes down to fixed and variable revenue and expenses (i.e., to determine the team\u2019s operating leverage). For many teams, revenue streams such as streaming, broadcast, and other media rights are \u201crelatively fixed\u201d and have built-in escalations, such as $50 or $100 million yearly increases. Therefore, most of the revenue analysis comes down to predictions for attendance, ticket prices, and merchandise spending. Player wages tend to be the biggest expense, so teams such as Manchester United like to tout their shorter contracts to position themselves as being more \u201cflexible\u201d:  The tricky part is that while player wages could fluctuate a lot, they\u2019re not exactly variable expenses; they\u2019re more like \u201charder-to-predict expenses\u201d because they change based on player trades, contract lengths, and salary caps. There\u2019s also some variation in how teams account for player wages, training, and equipment, with some capitalizing and amortizing this spending over time. Fixed expenses include property maintenance, professional fees, advertising\/marketing, security, catering, and general\/administrative. Representative Public Companies: Flutter Entertainment (FanDuel and Betfair ), DraftKings, Madison Square Garden Sports (they also own esports teams), Tencent (they do everything), Catapult Group (sports analytics), Playtech, and Sportradar Group. We are counting esports for video games, online gambling, and sports betting in this category. Offline casino companies are not included because the dynamics are different: A big physical footprint means higher fixed expenses and dependence on in-person traffic, so they fall into the real estate investment banking category. By contrast, many of these online betting and gaming companies are more like SaaS or consumer tech companies, with key drivers such as monthly active users, average revenue per user (ARPU), and even SaaS metrics like LTV and CAC. Companies such as FaZe in esports \/ gaming even welcome the comparison:   The analysis here is all about audience size, retention, per-user monetization, and margins in different scenarios. Think TMT but with a football or baseball in your right hand and a mouse in your left. Representative Public Companies: N\/A since these are almost always owned by cities, corporations, or specific teams. Analysis of stadiums and arenas is the most specialized of anything here, but it\u2019s also very close to what you do in public finance, real estate, or project finance. This BofA presentation on the Raiders\u2019 stadium in Clark County has many key points, as does this one for the Tennessee Titans\u2019 stadium. In short, the construction timeline and funding sources are critical for these projects. Is it a mixed public\/private project with some government contribution? Does the team contribute cash or any portion of its future revenue to fund the project? If the local government is issuing new general obligation (GO) bonds to finance the project, what type of state\/local tax is it implementing to support them? Will there be an additional ticket or hotel occupancy tax to fund this? For more on these points, please see the public finance investment banking article and the analytical examples there. Once the stadium or arena becomes operational, it resembles more of a mature real estate project, such as a \u201ccore\u201d property with a healthy net operating income (NOI) margin. Here\u2019s a good example for the Aloha Stadium redevelopment project, which has a very aggressive projected improvement:  We\u2019ll focus on teams and leagues in this section because the other verticals are covered in the other industry group articles on the site. My high-level summary would be: 1) Focus on Revenue Multiples \u2013 Many teams are not run efficiently and have low\/negative cash flows and earnings, so revenue multiples are more common than EBITDA, P\/E, or other valuation multiples. Also, different multiples may be applied to different revenue streams (see below). \u00a02) Quirks Around Player Salaries, Payrolls, and Expense Recognition \u2013 Because player payrolls are a huge expense but also an inconsistent and highly variable one, you\u2019ll sometimes see \u201cEBITDA ex. Payroll\u201d numbers used in valuations. Here\u2019s an example from BofA\u2019s analysis of the LA Clippers:  3) Royalty Relief and IP Valuation \u2013 To value a sports team\u2019s intangible assets, you might use the \u201cRoyalty Relief\u201d approach, which measures the theoretical cost of the team licensing their brand from a 3rd It requires assumptions for the revenue derived from the brand, the royalty rate, and the discount rate:  4) Sum-of-the-Parts Valuations and Blended Multiples \u2013 Since teams have revenue from varied sources, banks might value them based on the Sum-of-the-Parts approach and assign different multiples to each segment. They might also use \u201cblended multiples\u201d or \u201cprimary and secondary comps\u201d:  5) \u201cEmotional\u201d Valuations \u2013 Finally, team valuations are often irrational because many deals involve individual billionaires as buyers or sellers. So, the price paid may be totally disconnected from the asset\u2019s historical or projected cash flows. Yes, this also happens in other sectors, but it\u2019s more prevalent in sports. Finding these presentations and Fairness Opinions was quite difficult because most sports M&A deals involve non-public assets. That said, I managed to locate a few examples in each category: Los Angeles Clippers \u2013 Acquisition (BofA) Silver Lake \/ Endeavor \u2013 Acquisition (Barclays, BofA, Centerview, DB, HSBC, JPM, MS, RBC, GS, Raine, and Wells Fargo) Madison Square Garden Entertainment \/ MSG Networks \u2013 Acquisition (Moelis, Raine, JPM, PJT, GS, Guggenheim, LionTree, and MS) Liberty Media \/ Dorna Sports (Moto GP) \u2013 Acquisition (GS and Moelis) Courtside Group \/ PodcastOne \u2013 Restructuring and IPO (Roth Capital Partners) Wanda Sports Group \u2013 U.S. Delisting and Acquisition by Wanda Sports & Media (DB) HUYA \/ DouYu + Penguin E-Sports \u2013 Acquisition (GS, MS, and Citi) FaZe Clan \u2013 SPAC IPO (B. Riley, M. Klein, and Evolution Media Capital) Clark County Stadium Authority (Las Vegas Raiders) \u2013 Financing (BofA) Tennessee Titans Stadium \u2013 Financing (GS, JPM, and several regional\/boutique banks) Aloha Stadium Redevelopment \u2013 Development Consortium NASCAR \/ International Speedway \u2013 Acquisition (GS and DBO) Since sports IB is a rather new field, there are no real\/consistent \u201cleague tables\u201d yet. Among the bulge brackets, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan should be at the top of this list now that they have dedicated teams (plus their existing reputations and market shares). BofA is also strong, and you\u2019ll see Citi, DB, and MS on many deals as well. Outside the bulge brackets, many elite boutiques also advise on sports deals: PJT, Moelis, Evercore, and Rothschild (more so in Europe) are all examples. LionTree and Allen & Co. are also on many sports deals, especially media-related ones. Two of the best-known sports boutique banks are Inner Circle Sports and Galatioto Sports Partners; others include Park Lane, Game Plan LLC, and Grimes, McGovern & Associates (the last one is more active in the \u201cevents \u201d space). Finally, Tifosy is a merchant bank that does a mix of sports advisory and lending\/investing work. The good news is that no matter what you do, you probably won\u2019t be pigeonholed because sports is a broad area without much specialized analysis. Yes, sports private equity is one potential exit opportunity, but there aren\u2019t that many dedicated firms, so I\u2019m not sure how viable it is. That said, you could go to plenty of TMT or technology PE firms or others that focus on real estate or infrastructure, depending on your experience. Hedge funds are not especially viable because most sports teams and related assets are not publicly traded; the \u201cplay\u201d here would be to aim for tech or TMT funds with some sports exposure. Many bankers think about joining a sports team or league doing corporate development or business development work, which is possible (e.g., Madison Square Garden hires ex-bankers and consultants for these roles). But beware that these roles have notoriously long hours with high stress and relatively poor pay \u2013 because \u201ceveryone\u201d wants to work in sports finance. It\u2019s the same issue you run into when considering work in movies, TV, video games, or fashion: Since the industry is so desirable, they can afford to underpay and overwork you. Some good resources for learning more about sports finance include: Sports M&A and investing have become hot fields in recent years, but I\u2019m not sure I would recommend joining the sports investment banking team for your first full-time role. The problem is that sectors like this can quickly go from \u201chot\u201d to \u201cnot\u201d as macro conditions change, which means you might get poor or nonexistent deal experience. The concept of institutionalized sports investing and deal-making is still new compared to other sectors, so you are taking a chance. So, I would recommend joining a related coverage team (TMT, RE, PF, etc.) and gaining solid deal experience there first.

Register for Social Media Week before December 16 to lock in early-bird rates and save 50% on your pass. From business tariffs to regulatory overhauls and anti-immigration policies, the cloud of Donald Trump\u2019s second presidency looms large over U.S. and global businesses. One department has already been weathering a public storm under atmospheric pressure from conservative activists: corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). At Adcolor\u2019s annual conference in Los Angeles last month, members of the ad industry told ADWEEK they were determined to reverse politicized thinking around DEI, positioning it as an all-inclusive growth lever. However, for the CEOs and CMOs whom agencies serve, DEI communications will only get more complicated in the era of Trump 2.0 as executives shy away from activist leadership to avoid alienating already divided consumers.  Walmart is the latest (and largest) brand to rollback its DEI initiatives, announcing last week it would no longer use the term \u201cDEI\u201d in official communications nor consider gender and race when offering contracts to suppliers. Jeannette Nagy, CEO of crisis communications consultancy Clifftide, has seen an uptick in CEOs seeking guidance around addressing DEI issues this year, something she attributes to political polarization and evolving stakeholder expectations.  She says crisis-driven sensitivity, i.e. how inclusive campaigns from brands like Jaguar, Bud Light, or Walgreens subsidiary Boots can become a lightning rod for controversy and conservative backlash, is also to blame.  Back in 2018, under the previous Trump administration, CEO activism was the trend du jour. Former PayPal boss Dan Schulman took a stand against gendered bathroom rules in North Carolina, while others, like Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Howard Schultz, formerly of Starbucks, spoke publicly on everything from LGBTQ+ rights to racial inequality.  Public commitments to DEI became all the more prevalent in 2020 after George Floyd\u2019s murder sparked nationwide protests against racial inequality. This time around, however, CEOs have been \u201creactive rather than proactive\u201d in their communications about Trump\u2019s second win, Nagy observed. \u201cWhile some leaders have taken steps to prepare for increased polarization, many are hesitant to address Trump-era implications directly due to fears of alienating stakeholders,\u201d she added. \u201cThis hesitation can leave a vacuum, allowing external narratives to dominate.\u201d Trump already has some notable bosses on his side, most famously X owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose support has earned him a place as the politician\u2019s efficiency czar. Others, particularly those with reason to fear retribution from the president-elect, were congratulatory versus contemptuous toward Trump after his win.   JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs\u2019 bosses circulated memos post-election congratulating Trump, for instance. Tech CEOs concerned about regulation, including Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Apple\u2019s Cook, and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai, reached out to Mr. Trump directly in the weeks and months before the first ballot was cast, reported The New York Times. Long before the red wave took hold on Nov. 6, brands started culling both internal DEI programs and marketing initiatives. Earlier in 2024, Ford ditched DEI quotas, while Loewe\u2019s stopped sponsoring LGBTQ+ Pride parades and Harley Davidson cut minority and women-owned spending supplier goals.  In November, immediately after the election, Boeing quietly dismantled its entire DEI department, accepting the resignation of its vp and reallocating staff to other departments including HR.  \u201cDEI hushing,\u201d where companies no longer boast about progress or highlight their shortcomings, is also on the rise. 2023 data from financial research platform AlphaSense found mentions of \u201cESG,\u201d \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion,\u201d \u201cDEI,\u201d or \u201csustainability\u201d during quarterly investor calls were down 31% year-on-year. For Elly Dembo, global head of data and intelligence at McCann Worldgroup, leaders will have a tightrope to walk between politics and purpose in 2025.  When it comes to weighing in on hot-button issues, McCan\u2019s recent Truth Central research, which surveyed 2,400 people across all 50 states, found that 71% of Americans expect brands to stand up for what they believe in. However, only 19% believe that brands should make political statements.  \u201cIn a time when people around the country are feeling uneasy, it\u2019s unsurprising that they\u2019re seeking stability as they look towards the future:\u00a073% of people in the U.S. say they would rather live in a country that is always stable vs. always changing,\u201d said Dembo.  She added that people are looking for brands to help create stability, while still staying true to who they are \u2013 creating a delicate balance for leaders to meet societal demands without overstepping. While the ad industry is still processing Trump\u2019s victory, Sheryl Daija, founder of Bridge, an organization that helps companies build DEI initiatives, is optimistic that agencies and brands can work to untangle DEI from politics in 2025. \u201cDEI has become conflated with ESG and purpose, rather than something that should run across the whole business,\u201d she said. After George Floyd\u2019s murder, she observed how brands \u201crushed\u201d to show up for the Black community: \u201cInstead of finding skilled [DEI] practitioners, they identified people of color in the marketing department as the \u2018DEI person\u2019,\u201d she explained. She said this led to \u201cperformative\u201d pledges from brands and a misconception that DEI is \u201conly about talent.\u201d Conservatives were able to seize on this and turn it into a political tool. Bridge added four new members to its network in the two weeks after Trump was elected, Daija revealed, including a \u201chuge Fortune 500 brand.\u201d She believes these sign-ups, which outweigh the typical registrations the organization expects to see in that timeframe, represent a hunger from businesses to depoliticize the issue and move forward, rather than backward. She is in no doubt that the president-elect will be a harbinger of changes for DEI departments. Indeed, Bridge has just published a primer on what \u201cProject 2025,\u201d a 900-page policy \u201cwish list\u201d of proposals from right-wing think tank the Heritage Foundation, might mean for businesses.  \u201cWhen you hear the new administration talking about DEI like it just happened yesterday, you can hear a total misunderstanding and misconceptions of what they even think it is,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish we had an administration open to learning, but I\u2019m not sure we do.\u201d For Nagy, the best thing marketers can do is anchor their DEI messaging in company values and purpose, so it\u2019s not seen as a response to external pressure, and therefore open to attack. \u201cIt becomes less about politics and more about organizational integrity,\u201d she said.  Internally, she wants brands to encourage open dialogue with employees and acknowledge differing perspectives while reinforcing the importance of inclusion for long-term success.  \u201cConsistency in action and communication builds trust and credibility,\u201d she said.

The managers misrepresented or omitted key pricing details in 24 bond transactions, leading to overcharges. The bank has since taken corrective measures. Published on By The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced on 2 December 2024 that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPM) has been fined S$2.4 million for failing to detect and prevent misconduct by its relationship managers (RMs). The violations occurred during 24 over-the-counter (OTC) bond transactions where clients were charged spreads exceeding pre-agreed rates. According to MAS, the RMs provided inaccurate or incomplete information to clients about the pricing components of these transactions. This misconduct resulted in clients unknowingly paying spreads higher than what was bilaterally agreed. The violations contravened sections 201(c) and 201(d) of the Securities and Futures Act (SFA), which regulate transparency and fair dealing in financial services. The misconduct came to light during MAS\u2019s review of pricing and disclosure practices in the private banking sector. MAS revealed that JPMorgan\u2019s processes for determining and disclosing spreads were inadequate. Clients depended on RMs\u2019 representations of interbank prices, as such prices were not accessible to them. JPMorgan failed to ensure that its RMs adhered to the agreed pricing terms. Investigations found systemic lapses in JPMorgan\u2019s pricing frameworks and internal controls. These weaknesses enabled the RMs to misrepresent price components or withhold material information, thereby violating client trust. MAS sampled the bank\u2019s OTC bond transactions and confirmed that 24 cases involved such breaches. JPMorgan has admitted liability under section 236C of the SFA for its failure to monitor and prevent these actions. As part of the resolution, the bank paid the civil penalty to MAS and refunded the overcharged fees to affected clients. Additionally, JPMorgan has implemented measures to strengthen its pricing controls and ensure compliance. These enhancements aim to prevent similar issues from recurring. In a statement provided to the media, JPMorgan acknowledged the findings of MAS\u2019s review, describing them as part of an industry-wide thematic inspection. \u201cAs part of an industry-wide thematic inspection, JP Morgan Private Bank participated in a review that found certain deficiencies in past pricing and disclosure practices,\u201d the bank stated. JPMorgan highlighted that after completing its own internal review in 2020, it fully reimbursed affected clients. The transactions in question represented \u201ca very small portion of the total trades processed during the related period,\u201d the bank added. To address the deficiencies, JPMorgan stated that it has \u201cundertaken a comprehensive update to its internal controls, monitoring, and training framework\u201d to enhance trade governance, pricing transparency, and compliance practices. \u201cWe are pleased to have this matter resolved and remain dedicated to delivering an exceptional experience for our clients,\u201d the bank noted. MAS stated that investigations into the individual relationship managers responsible for the misconduct are still ongoing. The regulatory body emphasised the importance of robust internal controls in financial institutions to uphold transparency and fair dealing. In its press release, MAS clarified that a civil penalty action is distinct from a criminal proceeding and does not attract criminal sanctions. The civil penalty regime, operational since 2004, was designed to complement criminal sanctions, offering a nuanced approach to addressing market misconduct. Under section 232 of the Securities and Futures Act (SFA), MAS may enter into an agreement with any party to pay a civil penalty for contravening provisions under Part 12 of the Act, with or without admission of liability. The penalty can be up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided as a result of the contravention, subject to a minimum of S$50,000 for individuals and S$100,000 for corporations.

Posted on 11\/30\/2024 7:45:11 AM PST by SeekAndFind Incoming President Donald Trump and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon have quietly been in talks for months through secret back channels, serving as the \u201csounding board\u201d for the 47th president\u2019s pending economic agenda. Four sources close to the incoming Trump Administration confirmed that the president-elect and Dimon discussed issues before and after the election, such as reducing government spending, tax policy, trade, and banking regulations. The GOP insiders told the New York Post that Trump\u2019s aides regularly set up phone calls to \u201ccreate a bit of daylight\u201d between Trump and Dimon and prevent any information from reaching the press. The calls between Trump and the Wall Street mogul were \u201cno-holds-barred conversations.\u201d Dimon was floated as a potential pick as Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary at the time. However, despite calling Dimon a \u201chighly overrated Globalist\u201d in the past, Trump said he respected the banking CEO and dismissed rumors that he would serve in the Trump Administration. Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"I thank Jamie for his outstanding service to our Country!\u201d In response, Dimon replied, \u201cI haven't had a boss in 25 years, and I'm not about ready to start.\" Instead, Trump nominated Key Square founder Scott Bessent as his pick for Treasury secretary. While Dimon did not publicly endorse Trump for president, he said Wall Street bankers were \u201cdancing in the street\u201d after the Republican\u2019s sweeping defeat over failed Democrat candidate Vice President Kamala Harris. He also applauded Trump\u2019s new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by billionaire Elon Musk and Ohio businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, saying that the U.S. was long overdue for a department that makes the \u201cgovernment more efficient.\u201d\u00a0Dimon respected Trump\u2019s threats of tariffs on the country\u2019s trading partners, saying that they \u201cwill bring people to the table\u201d if \u201cdone wisely.\u201d The Post reported that out of revenge, the Biden Administration blacklisted Dimon from White House invites after appearing to support Trump\u2019s agenda.\u00a0\n\nTOPICS: Business\/Economy; Culture\/Society; Government; News\/Current Events\nKEYWORDS: dimon; economy; jamiedimon\n\n\nNavigation: use the links below to view more comments.\nfirst 1-20,\u00a021 next last\n\n\n\n\n1\nposted on 11\/30\/2024 7:45:11 AM PST\nby SeekAndFind\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: SeekAndFind\n\nDimon seems to be a very dangerous snake.\n\n2\nposted on 11\/30\/2024 7:47:43 AM PST\nby brownsfan\n(It's going to take real, serious, hard times to wake the American public.)\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 1\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: brownsfan\n\n\n\n3\nposted on 11\/30\/2024 7:49:56 AM PST\nby SeekAndFind\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 2\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: brownsfan\n\nIF he is \u201cOur\u201d snake then its all good\n\n4\nposted on 11\/30\/2024 7:52:42 AM PST\nby Fai Mao\n(The US government is run by pedophiles and Perverts for pedophiles and perverts)\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 2\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: SeekAndFind\n\nWhat can Dimon do that Peter Navarro couldn\u2019t do?\n\n5\nposted on 11\/30\/2024 7:53:11 AM PST\nby OKSooner\n(Nucular combat, toe to toe with the Rooskies! )\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 1\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: SeekAndFind\n\nBTTT\n\n6\nposted on 11\/30\/2024 7:55:04 AM PST\nby nopardons\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 1\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: SeekAndFind\n\n\u201cprivate\u201d channels...Media likes to spike the ball...\n\n7\nposted on 11\/30\/2024 7:56:11 AM PST\nby Sacajaweau\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 1\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: SeekAndFind\n\nI have to laugh when I think of Kamala trying to talk to these people.\n\n8\nposted on 11\/30\/2024 8:00:35 AM PST\nby ryderann\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 1\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: Sacajaweau\n\nThey passed notes in class.\n\n9\nposted on 11\/30\/2024 8:00:44 AM PST\nby crusty old prospector\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 7\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: SeekAndFind\n\nAnd how has JPM re-positioned it\u2019s investment banking portfolio over these many months to front-run all of the policies?\n\n10\nposted on 11\/30\/2024 8:03:50 AM PST\nby Macoozie\n(Roll MAGA, roll!)\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 1\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: Fai Mao\n\nDon\u2019t you remember JP Morgan begged Soros to be their CEO?\nDang, I thought Trump learned his lesson the first time...\n\n11\nposted on 11\/30\/2024 8:10:33 AM PST\nby bgill\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 4\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: Sacajaweau\n\nOf course, the \u2018Rats have been using \u201csecret back channels\u201d to distribute their talking points to the partisan press for decades, but that\u2019s not news.\n\n12\nposted on 11\/30\/2024 8:11:31 AM PST\nby Empire_of_Liberty\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 7\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: ryderann\n\n\u201cI have to laugh when I think of Kamala trying to talk to these people.\u201d\nthat thought never even occurred to me, but yeah, sort of like a five year old demanding to be moved from the kids table to the adult table ...\n\n13\nposted on 11\/30\/2024 8:57:50 AM PST\nby catnipman\n((A Vote For The Lesser Of Two Evils Still Counts As A Vote For Evil))\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 8\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: SeekAndFind\n\nprevent any information from reaching the pressI'd say that was a fail.\n\n14\nposted on 11\/30\/2024 9:16:18 AM PST\nby HartleyMBaldwin\n\n[\nPost Reply\n | Private Reply\n | To 1\n | View Replies]\n\nTo: brownsfan\n\nDimon is a self serving, back stabbing serpent.

The GOP insiders told the New York Post that Trump\u2019s aides regularly set up phone calls to \u201ccreate a bit of daylight\u201d between Trump and Dimon and prevent any information from reaching the press. The calls between Trump and the Wall Street mogul were \u201cno-holds-barred conversations.\u201d Dimon was floated as a potential pick as Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary at the time. However, despite calling Dimon a \u201chighly overrated Globalist\u201d in the past, Trump said he respected the banking CEO and dismissed rumors that he would serve in the Trump Administration. Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"I thank Jamie for his outstanding service to our Country!\u201d In response, Dimon replied, \u201cI haven't had a boss in 25 years, and I'm not about ready to start.\" Instead, Trump nominated Key Square founder Scott Bessent as his pick for Treasury secretary.

Foley & Lardner, LLP, decided today by Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman (N.D. Ill.): The following facts are accepted as true for the purpose of resolving Defendant's partial motion to dismiss. Plaintiff is an Arab Muslim woman who graduated from Georgetown University Law Center in 2023. While in law school, Plaintiff worked at Defendant's Chicago law office as a summer associate during Summer 2022. On July 29, 2022, Defendant offered Plaintiff a position as a full-time associate attorney, starting in Fall 2023, after Plaintiff's law school graduation. When applying for summer associate positions, Plaintiff alleges that a law firm's commitment to diversity and retaining diverse associates was important to her as an Arab Muslim woman. Because Plaintiff saw no references to either \"Muslim\" or \"Arab\" in Defendant's recruiting materials and learned that Defendant had no specific affinity group for Muslim or Arab attorneys, Plaintiff decided to discuss her concerns with Alexis Robertson, Defendant's Director of Diversity and Inclusion. In July 2022, Plaintiff spoke with Robertson to ensure that Defendant would support her \"authentic self.\" Plaintiff alleges that Robertson promised her that Defendant \"valued and supported [her] Arab Muslim heritage and perspective and embraced her history and values.\" Plaintiff alleges that Robertson's assurances were critical to her decision to accept the full-time employment offer and not pursue other job opportunities.  Plaintiff was scheduled to start her job on October 23, 2023. In the weeks leading up to the scheduled start date, Plaintiff, a long-time supporter of Palestinian human rights, spoke out about Israel's bombing of the civilians of Gaza following the Hamas attack against Israel on her personal social media accounts and at an October 11, 2023 meeting at the City of Chicago's City Hall. Plaintiff alleges that, prior to her scheduled start date, Defendant began investigating her background and found her social media posts speaking out in support of Gaza. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant's management personnel, including Robertson, then created a plan to rescind Plaintiff's employment offer. On October 21, 2023, Lisa Noller, a partner and chair of Defendant's litigation group, asked Plaintiff to attend a meeting the following day at Defendant's Chicago office to discuss Plaintiff's social media presence. Plaintiff reached out to Robertson for guidance and support, but Robertson never responded. On October 22, 2023, Plaintiff attended the meeting with Noller and Frank Pasquesi, the managing partner of Defendant's Chicago office. During the meeting, Plaintiff alleges that she was interrogated in a hostile manner about her student activism, community associations, remarks at the October 11, 2023 City Hall meeting, and social media posts about Hamas's attack and Israel's response. Plaintiff alleges that she was also interrogated about her previous leadership role in Law Students for Justice in Palestine (\"SJP\"), a Georgetown University Law Center student organization, and SJP's recent posts about the conflict, despite Plaintiff's contention that she was no longer involved in SJP after graduation. Following the meeting, and later that same day, Defendant revoked Plaintiff's employment offer. Plaintiff sued, alleging, among other things, promissory estoppel, which is cousin to breach of contract. But the court dismissed that claim: The salient question here is whether Robertson's statements that Defendant valued and supported Plaintiff's Arab Muslim heritage and perspective and embraced her history and values constituted an unambiguous promise that Plaintiff's employment offer would not be rescinded for her activism and advocacy efforts that she viewed as supportive of her Arab Muslim heritage. The Court holds that it does not. Plaintiff offers no evidence to support a finding that Defendant's promise of support was an unambiguous promise to not penalize Plaintiff for any actions she took as long as she believed they were in support of her Arab Muslim heritage. To conclude otherwise would mean that Plaintiff would have a \"get out of jail free card\" for any action that she took, even if it violated Defendant's values and policies, due to her status as an Arab Muslim woman. Plaintiff further alleges that Robertson knew Plaintiff was active in the Arab Muslim community, and thus Robertson's statements meant that Defendant would support Plaintiff's activism. To support her argument, Plaintiff attaches her resume and an essay she authored as exhibits to her response brief to show that Defendant was aware of her involvement with SJP and her experience as an Arab Muslim woman. But neither Plaintiff's alleged facts nor the exhibits reasonably impute knowledge of Plaintiff's activism to Robertson, much less Defendant. Nor does Plaintiff allege that she had conversations with Robertson about such activism. The case Plaintiff cites is also unpersuasive. In Dugas-Filippi v. JP Morgan Chase, N.A. (N.D. Ill. 2014), the court found that an employer's oral promise that plaintiff would not be fired if she took six-month paid discretionary leave was sufficiently clear and definite to support a promissory estoppel claim where plaintiff was fired for taking the six-month discretionary leave despite the employer's at-will policy. Here, Robertson's statements made no promise that Plaintiff's employment would not be rescinded. Instead, the statements only concerned support for Plaintiff as an Arab Muslim woman. here was no implicit promise that Plaintiff had total job protection no matter what she did or said so long as she believed those actions were related to her ethnicity, religion, or association. Plaintiff essentially asks the Court to conclude that the parties understood that the promise of support implied a promise of job security regardless of Plaintiff's actions. However, the facts do not support the existence of a common understanding among the parties that would transform Robertson's statements of support into a promise to not rescind Plaintiff's employment offer. The Court finds that there was no unambiguous promise and no common understanding among the parties to support a promissory estoppel claim. Plaintiff also sued for discrimination based on ethnicity, religion, and association; those claims weren't the subject of a motion to dismiss, and still remain. Note that Illinois law restricts private threats aimed at speech related to candidates or ballot measures: Any person who, by force, intimidation, threat, deception or forgery, knowingly prevents any other person from (a) registering to vote, or (b) lawfully voting, supporting or opposing the nomination or election of any person for public office or any public question voted upon at any election, shall be guilty of a \u2026 felony [and shall be subject to civil liability]. This prohibition on \"threat[s]\" may cover not just threats of crime but also threats of economic retaliation: Thus, for instance, federal law bans \"intimidat[ing], threaten[ing], coerc[ing], or attempt[ing] to intimidate, threaten, or coerce any other person for the purpose of interfering with the right of such other person \u2026 to vote as he may choose\" has been interpreted as prohibiting threats of economic retaliation. Likewise, the Fair Housing Act makes it illegal \"to coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any person \u2026 or on account of his having aided or encouraged any other person in the exercise or enjoyment [of housing nondiscrimination rights],\" and courts have interpreted this as barring the firing of employees who rented to black and Mexican-American applicants, and barring the denial of agency funds to an organization that complained about a discriminatory permit denial. But, unlike the statutes in some other states (and ordinances in some cities and counties, including in Urbana), the Illinois statute doesn't extend to job discrimination based on advocacy of ideological views that aren't directly tied to elections. Gerald L. Pauling and Tracy M. Billows (Seyfarth Shaw LLP) represent defendant.

For example, I think my introduction to sociology and psychology philosophy and now economics actually is all around this question. According to Mises, and the Austrian school of economics, they believe it is rational. Not rational like if we think it is wise or foolish, but rational in so far much as giving individual agents, individual human beings dignity and respect, and knowing that as much as we might like to wag fingers about them doing something foolish, in fact, there is a deeper sense of logic that we may not understand on a superficial level, but there is often a deeper sense of meaning that we must try to decipher. For example, when I often look at the behaviors of others, it seems befuddling to me, and also foolish on my end. But, I\u2019m probably 100% certain the other people think the same about myself. And it seems unfitting for me to just put myself on a pedestal, and assume that all of my thoughts actions aims and desires are supreme, and everybody else beneath me is inferior. The truth is I actually see myself as a pretty ordinary normal kind of average person. I think perhaps instead, my superpower lies around the fact that i\u2019m kind of like a big kid, like I\u2019m the most curious person that I personally know. And I think in modern day times, especially becoming an adult, I think curiosity is courageous. \ufffc\ufffc So what is the number one favorite past time of Americans? Criticizing and critiquing the parenting behaviors of others. First, if people gonna wanna act basic in a way that you don\u2019t approve of, why do you care? Like are you going to pick it McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks Frappuccino\u2019s, trying to tell everyone not to consume it? To me this is kind of a waste of time and not very effective. So then if I think about this deeply, why is it that we criticizing critique other people, their behaviors their thoughts the way they spend their money etc.? First, I cannot speak for other people but let me talk from my perspective. So for myself, maybe for me I\u2019m trying to put myself in the issues of others, and essentially I\u2019m just trying to share information knowledge wisdom experiences \ufffc, trying to \u201chelp\u201dothers, as if I was them. Now the reason why this might not always be a good thing is that there are a lot of people who do not want to be \u201chelped\u201d. There are some people who want to simply keep to themselves, and they don\u2019t want to be disturbed, and that\u2019s totally cool too. So one big idea I have is maybe the losing bet is trying to work so hard to understand other people. Isn\u2019t it more effective to try to seek to understand yourself? So obviously everyone thinks different and is different, but I do think that maybe, by using yourself as your own magnifying glass, you could seek to understand all of humanity. Why? First, my honest belief is that humans are more similar than dissimilar. \ufffc and also human motivations and desires have not changed much from ancient Greece. So for example this is where I find that reading to Emily Wilson translations of the Elliot and now the odyssey are really really fascinating because it gives us better insight into maybe more core critical human values, human nature in general? My personal belief is that if you understand the route of human behavior action desires activity etc.\u2026 you kind of understand everything. For example, in the context of sociology\u2026 My greatest Boon to studying sociology was it was like my gateway drug to understanding all of human society, and also, individual human actions and activities. For example, sociology got me into psychology, which then got me into social media, social media marketing and blogging, and also\u2026 If history and travel and lifestyle, then philosophy, stoicism, Zen Zen Buddhism Taoism wabi sabi, ethics, aesthetics, and now the philosophy of money economics and bitcoin. What is the greatest moving force on the planet? Curiosity. Curiosity means what you care for. You cannot fake curiosity, nor can you force it. It is simply something that is natural innate, that which flows from within you. And I think that may be the root of curiosity is enthusiasm, a god dwelling within you. Also the same notion of having a purpose in life, a passion, all kind of a similar thing. I think it is not zero son; you can have more than one purpose in life, directive in life, imperative in life. But once again, assuming that like 90% of the world\u2019s problems are rooted in the economic, shouldn\u2019t the Y strategy be to try to seek to understand \u201cfix\u201d or at least address the economic question? I think when it comes down to it if you could just pinpoint one thing, it will always be 100% about the economy. it\u2019s the economy stupid! Carthage must burn! Capitalism economics, economic theory, it is all very critical. So currently I think the modern day economists are the ones who are being fed endowment checks from Ivy League universities from Harvard Yale etc., and everyone is giving them the big bucks because they\u2019re like the new modern day wizards or sorcerers. The general idea is if we could fund the economist to understand economic question, this will make the institution super super rich. I cannot speak for institutions because I am just an individual and human being. And my whole realm of care is pretty small; my sphere of concern is myself, Cindy and Seneca, my mom, my sister and her future family and that\u2019s pretty much it. This is my real family. So first, my first imperative was securing a glorious and splendid future for myself Cindy Seneca my mom in our future growing family. And everything is optimized around this. So from the get-go, I\u2019ve always only ever been interested in practical matters. Even the reason why I love Stoicism Zen and Taoism so much is that it actually applies to real reality. Even my interest in sociology was it was really really practical useful has real utility in the real world! I still will never forget my horrifying experience studying basic introduction to philosophy class in which the professor, tried to turn logical thinking into mathematics? This horrified me forever. Remember as an undergraduate, desiring to study philosophy, trying to figure out the meaning of life etc., and being stuck doing this insane mathematical equations? Maybe instead of goals, pathways are a more interesting idea. A Pak, pathway is kind of the general direction you tread, and go. And obviously there is a lot of flexibility which is possible here. And what are the ultimate goals? I think human human nature or at least for myself is about the zest of life of striving for more! For example, growth is a primary motivator to me. I\u2019ll give you example, increase overtime, yield overtime. For example, a very simple way to understand things for myself is that I like to see the number go up! Change over time brings me joy. \ufffc For example, in terms of bitcoin, finances and monetary yield, I\u2019d like to see the number go up, not down! Also with weightlifting, powerlifting one rep Max lifting etc., I love to see my one rep Max numbers go up! Even look at myself in the mirror, flexing my arms and biceps and seeing the growth of my biceps my triceps, my whole body. This brings me infinite joy, also seeing my body gaining a beautiful glow and bronze tan. Even the joy of getting a clean fresh haircut from Cindy. Makes me feel so great and handsome! Assuming that your life is about joy maximization, having kids wireless one kid seems to make the most sense. For example, Odysseus and his son; fighting together teaming up together, busting out the arrows and killing the suitors in hilarious fashion. What is it that Odysseus wanted? It was super simple, just to go back home! To go back to his home \ufffc in Ithaca, with his wife Penelope, and his son. To grow old in his own land, with his wealth. What are my personal goals? For myself, I want to stack the bitcoin into infinity and beyond. I want to buy it up all of it, . So I was doing some mathematics, and it came to my attention that my favorite neighborhood of all time is comprise of 340 plots of land. Each plot of land being worth at least 1 million or $1.1 million. So a simple mathematical equation is assuming that one plot of land is equivalent to one bitcoin, which means even right now\u2026 I believe the true worth of a bitcoin even in 2024 should be at least 1 million or $1.1 million. So if I was a super awesome capitalist, I would just buy up the whole neighborhood. All 340 plots of land. 17\u00d720 For example, each little square block in my neighborhood has about 20 single-family homes, or at least 20 lots of land. Each plot of land is subdivided into around 5000 ft.\u00b2. And then there is about 17 square blocks, so 340 is 17\u00d720. So let us break it down real estate, or property. Or a single-family home whatever. First, the goal is to own the land, how much land? you want to own the best land, the most prime land, in the most prime location, there is no second best. So for example, it is my personal belief that in all of America maybe, Culver City, Los Angeles, CA 90232 is like 100% the best city in America, maybe the planet. Why? Supreme weather, supreme infrastructure, and a relatively small and modest city which feels like a big town. I think of Culver City like travel town, also another railroad LA public park you got to check out with your kid. Anyways, I think the thing with physical land and zoning which is interesting is that I guess you could expand the zoning of a city in a province but still\u2026 Even if you expand it upwards, there will be some other spots some other epicenters which are superior to other ones. I think this is a really really difficult concept to grasp, probably one of the best nuggets of wisdom from Michael Saylor. So for example, the best or nothing. Certainly the best car to own even if you were a trillionaire, in terms of comfort convenience and quality is probably a Lexus car. Not a loser Rolls-Royce, which is essentially a BMW with a body kit, not a Mercedes which is an unreliable triangle German loser car, not a Porsche which is essentially a Volkswagen beetle with a body kit, not a Lamborghini which is essentially a Volkswagen Passat on steroids, Not a Ferrari which is just like the ultimate deflationary asset? Certainly it is like Tesla or nothing. There is no second best electric vehicle. Tesla is the only electric vehicle. Bitcoin is the same. There is no second best. Not loser Ethereum, which is like having a Samsung android smart phone, the functionality might be better but nobody wants it. Everyone will always want the newest iPhone Pro, which is essentially like bitcoin. Except bitcoin is like 1 trillion times more valuable because it is an appreciating asset, rather than an iPhone Pro which is just a carpal tunnel inducing device, like a vape cigarette, an electronic cigarette. People always talk about how bitcoin is bad for the planet, but don\u2019t you fools realize that apple is bad for the planet? Apple is essentially leveraging slave labor in mainland China, fox con, putting up nuts so workers don\u2019t commit suicide, and then getting all these millennials, Gen Z vegans to purchase these overpriced iPhones? Apple might be the real scourge to the planet not bitcoin or meat. I\u2019m \ufffc starting to get the sense that actually\u2026 Maybe bitcoin will become the new religion, maybe it already is? Michael Saylor is like one of the living prophets, kind of like Saint Jude, or one of the patron Saints, like Patrick said on his podcast. Also, Satoshi is like the new Jesus who did the immaculate conception and ascended back into heaven, disappearing forever. Maybe Vitalik of Ethereum is like the guy who is building the statue of Babel? The new tower of Babel? Once again, it is an acid without an issuer, it is like gold, it is ethical. However, it is 1 trillion times more ethical than gold because gold is dug up using slave labor, human slave labor, and all this toxic chemicals and pollution created to harvest it from the Earth. What is also interesting to me from an environmental perspective is that the goal of a minor will always be to use the cheapest electricity to mine bitcoin. So in fact, the intelligence strategy if you were a minor is to just power your whole mining operation with like nuclear energy or other innovative energy sources which cost pretty much nothing. The downside of coal is that actually it is pretty expensive, ignore the fig news from mainland China. Also another dirty secret, the only reason why bitcoin got all this fake news about it being bad for the planet was Sam Bankman-Fried, the scam artist behind FTX, essentially paid millions of dollars to Democrats, Tom Brady, politicians influencers and the like and media outlets, also to major league baseball whatever, to spread this fake notion that bitcoin was bad for the planet, because he just wanted to pump up his own fake FTT coin, which is essentially like cotton candy. This is where the whole notion of proof of stake is positively moronic; only real value could be from real work, based in physics, physical reality. You must have to consume real electronic analog energy to produce a bitcoin which is what gives it its value. Not proof mistake which is just like an American colonist pulling up to the shores, putting a flag staking it into the ground and saying \u201cthis belongs to me!\u201d If you are anti-colonialism, you do not believe in proof of stake. \ufffc I think this is a really really really big idea. The idea and belief in fact, bitcoin could actually become a more ethical form of capitalism? So the big idea here is that cyber capitalism, if we think cyberspace, it is all so much more ethical. For example, in cyberspace there is no human death, no missiles, no refugees or hostages no human genocide. In cyberspace, it is all about wisdom truth, sovereignty and rights. For example, in cyberspace, no human beings are ever harmed. And if we think about the new arms race, the new arms race should simply be a bitcoin arms race, the basic idea that in fact, instead of stockpiling nukes, we stockpile the bitcoin instead! We are still in year zero of bitcoin, starting January 2025 will be year one. So one of the first very simple ideas I have is that currently, the use cases of bitcoin is still sparse. Imagine and remember the early days of the iPhone, in the early days of the App Store. I wonder if in the near future there will be some sort of bitcoin App Store, in which you could use your bitcoins for like infinite functions?

For example, I think my introduction to sociology and psychology philosophy and now economics actually is all around this question. According to Mises, and the Austrian school of economics, they believe it is rational. Not rational like if we think it is wise or foolish, but rational in so far much as giving individual agents, individual human beings dignity and respect, and knowing that as much as we might like to wag fingers about them doing something foolish, in fact, there is a deeper sense of logic that we may not understand on a superficial level, but there is often a deeper sense of meaning that we must try to decipher. For example, when I often look at the behaviors of others, it seems befuddling to me, and also foolish on my end. But, I\u2019m probably 100% certain the other people think the same about myself. And it seems unfitting for me to just put myself on a pedestal, and assume that all of my thoughts actions aims and desires are supreme, and everybody else beneath me is inferior. The truth is I actually see myself as a pretty ordinary normal kind of average person. I think perhaps instead, my superpower lies around the fact that i\u2019m kind of like a big kid, like I\u2019m the most curious person that I personally know. And I think in modern day times, especially becoming an adult, I think curiosity is courageous. \ufffc\ufffc So what is the number one favorite past time of Americans? Criticizing and critiquing the parenting behaviors of others. First, if people gonna wanna act basic in a way that you don\u2019t approve of, why do you care? Like are you going to pick it McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks Frappuccino\u2019s, trying to tell everyone not to consume it? To me this is kind of a waste of time and not very effective. So then if I think about this deeply, why is it that we criticizing critique other people, their behaviors their thoughts the way they spend their money etc.? First, I cannot speak for other people but let me talk from my perspective. So for myself, maybe for me I\u2019m trying to put myself in the issues of others, and essentially I\u2019m just trying to share information knowledge wisdom experiences \ufffc, trying to \u201chelp\u201dothers, as if I was them. Now the reason why this might not always be a good thing is that there are a lot of people who do not want to be \u201chelped\u201d. There are some people who want to simply keep to themselves, and they don\u2019t want to be disturbed, and that\u2019s totally cool too. So one big idea I have is maybe the losing bet is trying to work so hard to understand other people. Isn\u2019t it more effective to try to seek to understand yourself? So obviously everyone thinks different and is different, but I do think that maybe, by using yourself as your own magnifying glass, you could seek to understand all of humanity. Why? First, my honest belief is that humans are more similar than dissimilar. \ufffc and also human motivations and desires have not changed much from ancient Greece. So for example this is where I find that reading to Emily Wilson translations of the Elliot and now the odyssey are really really fascinating because it gives us better insight into maybe more core critical human values, human nature in general? My personal belief is that if you understand the route of human behavior action desires activity etc.\u2026 you kind of understand everything. For example, in the context of sociology\u2026 My greatest Boon to studying sociology was it was like my gateway drug to understanding all of human society, and also, individual human actions and activities. For example, sociology got me into psychology, which then got me into social media, social media marketing and blogging, and also\u2026 If history and travel and lifestyle, then philosophy, stoicism, Zen Zen Buddhism Taoism wabi sabi, ethics, aesthetics, and now the philosophy of money economics and bitcoin. What is the greatest moving force on the planet? Curiosity. Curiosity means what you care for. You cannot fake curiosity, nor can you force it. It is simply something that is natural innate, that which flows from within you. And I think that may be the root of curiosity is enthusiasm, a god dwelling within you. Also the same notion of having a purpose in life, a passion, all kind of a similar thing. I think it is not zero son; you can have more than one purpose in life, directive in life, imperative in life. But once again, assuming that like 90% of the world\u2019s problems are rooted in the economic, shouldn\u2019t the Y strategy be to try to seek to understand \u201cfix\u201d or at least address the economic question? I think when it comes down to it if you could just pinpoint one thing, it will always be 100% about the economy. it\u2019s the economy stupid! Carthage must burn! Capitalism economics, economic theory, it is all very critical. So currently I think the modern day economists are the ones who are being fed endowment checks from Ivy League universities from Harvard Yale etc., and everyone is giving them the big bucks because they\u2019re like the new modern day wizards or sorcerers. The general idea is if we could fund the economist to understand economic question, this will make the institution super super rich. I cannot speak for institutions because I am just an individual and human being. And my whole realm of care is pretty small; my sphere of concern is myself, Cindy and Seneca, my mom, my sister and her future family and that\u2019s pretty much it. This is my real family. So first, my first imperative was securing a glorious and splendid future for myself Cindy Seneca my mom in our future growing family. And everything is optimized around this. So from the get-go, I\u2019ve always only ever been interested in practical matters. Even the reason why I love Stoicism Zen and Taoism so much is that it actually applies to real reality. Even my interest in sociology was it was really really practical useful has real utility in the real world! I still will never forget my horrifying experience studying basic introduction to philosophy class in which the professor, tried to turn logical thinking into mathematics? This horrified me forever. Remember as an undergraduate, desiring to study philosophy, trying to figure out the meaning of life etc., and being stuck doing this insane mathematical equations? Maybe instead of goals, pathways are a more interesting idea. A Pak, pathway is kind of the general direction you tread, and go. And obviously there is a lot of flexibility which is possible here. And what are the ultimate goals? I think human human nature or at least for myself is about the zest of life of striving for more! For example, growth is a primary motivator to me. I\u2019ll give you example, increase overtime, yield overtime. For example, a very simple way to understand things for myself is that I like to see the number go up! Change over time brings me joy. \ufffc For example, in terms of bitcoin, finances and monetary yield, I\u2019d like to see the number go up, not down! Also with weightlifting, powerlifting one rep Max lifting etc., I love to see my one rep Max numbers go up! Even look at myself in the mirror, flexing my arms and biceps and seeing the growth of my biceps my triceps, my whole body. This brings me infinite joy, also seeing my body gaining a beautiful glow and bronze tan. Even the joy of getting a clean fresh haircut from Cindy. Makes me feel so great and handsome! Assuming that your life is about joy maximization, having kids wireless one kid seems to make the most sense. For example, Odysseus and his son; fighting together teaming up together, busting out the arrows and killing the suitors in hilarious fashion. What is it that Odysseus wanted? It was super simple, just to go back home! To go back to his home \ufffc in Ithaca, with his wife Penelope, and his son. To grow old in his own land, with his wealth. What are my personal goals? For myself, I want to stack the bitcoin into infinity and beyond. I want to buy it up all of it, . So I was doing some mathematics, and it came to my attention that my favorite neighborhood of all time is comprise of 340 plots of land. Each plot of land being worth at least 1 million or $1.1 million. So a simple mathematical equation is assuming that one plot of land is equivalent to one bitcoin, which means even right now\u2026 I believe the true worth of a bitcoin even in 2024 should be at least 1 million or $1.1 million. So if I was a super awesome capitalist, I would just buy up the whole neighborhood. All 340 plots of land. 17\u00d720 For example, each little square block in my neighborhood has about 20 single-family homes, or at least 20 lots of land. Each plot of land is subdivided into around 5000 ft.\u00b2. And then there is about 17 square blocks, so 340 is 17\u00d720. So let us break it down real estate, or property. Or a single-family home whatever. First, the goal is to own the land, how much land? you want to own the best land, the most prime land, in the most prime location, there is no second best. So for example, it is my personal belief that in all of America maybe, Culver City, Los Angeles, CA 90232 is like 100% the best city in America, maybe the planet. Why? Supreme weather, supreme infrastructure, and a relatively small and modest city which feels like a big town. I think of Culver City like travel town, also another railroad LA public park you got to check out with your kid. Anyways, I think the thing with physical land and zoning which is interesting is that I guess you could expand the zoning of a city in a province but still\u2026 Even if you expand it upwards, there will be some other spots some other epicenters which are superior to other ones. I think this is a really really difficult concept to grasp, probably one of the best nuggets of wisdom from Michael Saylor. So for example, the best or nothing. Certainly the best car to own even if you were a trillionaire, in terms of comfort convenience and quality is probably a Lexus car. Not a loser Rolls-Royce, which is essentially a BMW with a body kit, not a Mercedes which is an unreliable triangle German loser car, not a Porsche which is essentially a Volkswagen beetle with a body kit, not a Lamborghini which is essentially a Volkswagen Passat on steroids, Not a Ferrari which is just like the ultimate deflationary asset? Certainly it is like Tesla or nothing. There is no second best electric vehicle. Tesla is the only electric vehicle. Bitcoin is the same. There is no second best. Not loser Ethereum, which is like having a Samsung android smart phone, the functionality might be better but nobody wants it. Everyone will always want the newest iPhone Pro, which is essentially like bitcoin. Except bitcoin is like 1 trillion times more valuable because it is an appreciating asset, rather than an iPhone Pro which is just a carpal tunnel inducing device, like a vape cigarette, an electronic cigarette. People always talk about how bitcoin is bad for the planet, but don\u2019t you fools realize that apple is bad for the planet? Apple is essentially leveraging slave labor in mainland China, fox con, putting up nuts so workers don\u2019t commit suicide, and then getting all these millennials, Gen Z vegans to purchase these overpriced iPhones? Apple might be the real scourge to the planet not bitcoin or meat. I\u2019m \ufffc starting to get the sense that actually\u2026 Maybe bitcoin will become the new religion, maybe it already is? Michael Saylor is like one of the living prophets, kind of like Saint Jude, or one of the patron Saints, like Patrick said on his podcast. Also, Satoshi is like the new Jesus who did the immaculate conception and ascended back into heaven, disappearing forever. Maybe Vitalik of Ethereum is like the guy who is building the statue of Babel? The new tower of Babel? Once again, it is an acid without an issuer, it is like gold, it is ethical. However, it is 1 trillion times more ethical than gold because gold is dug up using slave labor, human slave labor, and all this toxic chemicals and pollution created to harvest it from the Earth. What is also interesting to me from an environmental perspective is that the goal of a minor will always be to use the cheapest electricity to mine bitcoin. So in fact, the intelligence strategy if you were a minor is to just power your whole mining operation with like nuclear energy or other innovative energy sources which cost pretty much nothing. The downside of coal is that actually it is pretty expensive, ignore the fig news from mainland China. Also another dirty secret, the only reason why bitcoin got all this fake news about it being bad for the planet was Sam Bankman-Fried, the scam artist behind FTX, essentially paid millions of dollars to Democrats, Tom Brady, politicians influencers and the like and media outlets, also to major league baseball whatever, to spread this fake notion that bitcoin was bad for the planet, because he just wanted to pump up his own fake FTT coin, which is essentially like cotton candy. This is where the whole notion of proof of stake is positively moronic; only real value could be from real work, based in physics, physical reality. You must have to consume real electronic analog energy to produce a bitcoin which is what gives it its value. Not proof mistake which is just like an American colonist pulling up to the shores, putting a flag staking it into the ground and saying \u201cthis belongs to me!\u201d If you are anti-colonialism, you do not believe in proof of stake. \ufffc I think this is a really really really big idea. The idea and belief in fact, bitcoin could actually become a more ethical form of capitalism? So the big idea here is that cyber capitalism, if we think cyberspace, it is all so much more ethical. For example, in cyberspace there is no human death, no missiles, no refugees or hostages no human genocide. In cyberspace, it is all about wisdom truth, sovereignty and rights. For example, in cyberspace, no human beings are ever harmed. And if we think about the new arms race, the new arms race should simply be a bitcoin arms race, the basic idea that in fact, instead of stockpiling nukes, we stockpile the bitcoin instead! We are still in year zero of bitcoin, starting January 2025 will be year one. So one of the first very simple ideas I have is that currently, the use cases of bitcoin is still sparse. Imagine and remember the early days of the iPhone, in the early days of the App Store. I wonder if in the near future there will be some sort of bitcoin App Store, in which you could use your bitcoins for like infinite functions? Even right now\u2026 You\u2019re starting to see innovation happen, like people using bitcoin to back big loans, mortgages and the like? JP Morgan Chase, I just actually found out that they are essentially sponsoring text stars LA, and assuming that JP Morgan Chase is all about money, monetary technology and wealth, wealth preservation and growth, it would almost be foolish for them to not build up their own bitcoin treasury reserve assets. I think also what makes Michael Saylor so great relatable, and human is that he has done so many interviews video podcast interviews and the like, with pretty much everybody, and you get to see him as a real human being. Also his Twitter is amazing it is the only one I follow. And it\u2019s kind of crazy\u2026 Micro strategy is almost close to 400,000 bitcoins and if you go to saylortracker.com, \ufffc and just look at the simple graphs, and also the simple numerical tables and balances and balance sheets, all of the micro strategy bitcoin buys have yielded a grand profit!

Anyways, I think the thing with physical land and zoning which is interesting is that I guess you could expand the zoning of a city in a province but still\u2026 Even if you expand it upwards, there will be some other spots some other epicenters which are superior to other ones. I think this is a really really difficult concept to grasp, probably one of the best nuggets of wisdom from Michael Saylor. So for example, the best or nothing. Certainly the best car to own even if you were a trillionaire, in terms of comfort convenience and quality is probably a Lexus car. Not a loser Rolls-Royce, which is essentially a BMW with a body kit, not a Mercedes which is an unreliable triangle German loser car, not a Porsche which is essentially a Volkswagen beetle with a body kit, not a Lamborghini which is essentially a Volkswagen Passat on steroids, Not a Ferrari which is just like the ultimate deflationary asset? Certainly it is like Tesla or nothing. There is no second best electric vehicle. Tesla is the only electric vehicle. Bitcoin is the same. There is no second best. Not loser Ethereum, which is like having a Samsung android smart phone, the functionality might be better but nobody wants it. Everyone will always want the newest iPhone Pro, which is essentially like bitcoin. Except bitcoin is like 1 trillion times more valuable because it is an appreciating asset, rather than an iPhone Pro which is just a carpal tunnel inducing device, like a vape cigarette, an electronic cigarette. People always talk about how bitcoin is bad for the planet, but don\u2019t you fools realize that apple is bad for the planet? Apple is essentially leveraging slave labor in mainland China, fox con, putting up nuts so workers don\u2019t commit suicide, and then getting all these millennials, Gen Z vegans to purchase these overpriced iPhones? Apple might be the real scourge to the planet not bitcoin or meat. I\u2019m \ufffc starting to get the sense that actually\u2026 Maybe bitcoin will become the new religion, maybe it already is? Michael Saylor is like one of the living prophets, kind of like Saint Jude, or one of the patron Saints, like Patrick said on his podcast. Also, Satoshi is like the new Jesus who did the immaculate conception and ascended back into heaven, disappearing forever. Maybe Vitalik of Ethereum is like the guy who is building the statue of Babel? The new tower of Babel? Once again, it is an acid without an issuer, it is like gold, it is ethical. However, it is 1 trillion times more ethical than gold because gold is dug up using slave labor, human slave labor, and all this toxic chemicals and pollution created to harvest it from the Earth. What is also interesting to me from an environmental perspective is that the goal of a minor will always be to use the cheapest electricity to mine bitcoin. So in fact, the intelligence strategy if you were a minor is to just power your whole mining operation with like nuclear energy or other innovative energy sources which cost pretty much nothing. The downside of coal is that actually it is pretty expensive, ignore the fig news from mainland China. Also another dirty secret, the only reason why bitcoin got all this fake news about it being bad for the planet was Sam Bankman-Fried, the scam artist behind FTX, essentially paid millions of dollars to Democrats, Tom Brady, politicians influencers and the like and media outlets, also to major league baseball whatever, to spread this fake notion that bitcoin was bad for the planet, because he just wanted to pump up his own fake FTT coin, which is essentially like cotton candy. This is where the whole notion of proof of stake is positively moronic; only real value could be from real work, based in physics, physical reality. You must have to consume real electronic analog energy to produce a bitcoin which is what gives it its value. Not proof mistake which is just like an American colonist pulling up to the shores, putting a flag staking it into the ground and saying \u201cthis belongs to me!\u201d If you are anti-colonialism, you do not believe in proof of stake. \ufffc I think this is a really really really big idea. The idea and belief in fact, bitcoin could actually become a more ethical form of capitalism? So the big idea here is that cyber capitalism, if we think cyberspace, it is all so much more ethical. For example, in cyberspace there is no human death, no missiles, no refugees or hostages no human genocide. In cyberspace, it is all about wisdom truth, sovereignty and rights. For example, in cyberspace, no human beings are ever harmed. And if we think about the new arms race, the new arms race should simply be a bitcoin arms race, the basic idea that in fact, instead of stockpiling nukes, we stockpile the bitcoin instead! We are still in year zero of bitcoin, starting January 2025 will be year one. So one of the first very simple ideas I have is that currently, the use cases of bitcoin is still sparse. Imagine and remember the early days of the iPhone, in the early days of the App Store. I wonder if in the near future there will be some sort of bitcoin App Store, in which you could use your bitcoins for like infinite functions? Even right now\u2026 You\u2019re starting to see innovation happen, like people using bitcoin to back big loans, mortgages and the like? JP Morgan Chase, I just actually found out that they are essentially sponsoring text stars LA, and assuming that JP Morgan Chase is all about money, monetary technology and wealth, wealth preservation and growth, it would almost be foolish for them to not build up their own bitcoin treasury reserve assets. I think also what makes Michael Saylor so great relatable, and human is that he has done so many interviews video podcast interviews and the like, with pretty much everybody, and you get to see him as a real human being. Also his Twitter is amazing it is the only one I follow. And it\u2019s kind of crazy\u2026 Micro strategy is almost close to 400,000 bitcoins and if you go to saylortracker.com, \ufffc and just look at the simple graphs, and also the simple numerical tables and balances and balance sheets, all of the micro strategy bitcoin buys have yielded a grand profit! It\u2019s all green! Maybe the new field of economics is more like personal economics, \ufffc your own personal economic theory for yourself, your kids your family etc. I guess the ultimate Takeaway point is you must posit this for yourself, not get it from others.

For example, I think my introduction to sociology and psychology philosophy and now economics actually is all around this question. According to Mises, and the Austrian school of economics, they believe it is rational. Not rational like if we think it is wise or foolish, but rational in so far much as giving individual agents, individual human beings dignity and respect, and knowing that as much as we might like to wag fingers about them doing something foolish, in fact, there is a deeper sense of logic that we may not understand on a superficial level, but there is often a deeper sense of meaning that we must try to decipher. For example, when I often look at the behaviors of others, it seems befuddling to me, and also foolish on my end. But, I\u2019m probably 100% certain the other people think the same about myself. And it seems unfitting for me to just put myself on a pedestal, and assume that all of my thoughts actions aims and desires are supreme, and everybody else beneath me is inferior. The truth is I actually see myself as a pretty ordinary normal kind of average person. I think perhaps instead, my superpower lies around the fact that i\u2019m kind of like a big kid, like I\u2019m the most curious person that I personally know. And I think in modern day times, especially becoming an adult, I think curiosity is courageous. \ufffc\ufffc So what is the number one favorite past time of Americans? Criticizing and critiquing the parenting behaviors of others. First, if people gonna wanna act basic in a way that you don\u2019t approve of, why do you care? Like are you going to pick it McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks Frappuccino\u2019s, trying to tell everyone not to consume it? To me this is kind of a waste of time and not very effective. So then if I think about this deeply, why is it that we criticizing critique other people, their behaviors their thoughts the way they spend their money etc.? First, I cannot speak for other people but let me talk from my perspective. So for myself, maybe for me I\u2019m trying to put myself in the issues of others, and essentially I\u2019m just trying to share information knowledge wisdom experiences \ufffc, trying to \u201chelp\u201dothers, as if I was them. Now the reason why this might not always be a good thing is that there are a lot of people who do not want to be \u201chelped\u201d. There are some people who want to simply keep to themselves, and they don\u2019t want to be disturbed, and that\u2019s totally cool too. So one big idea I have is maybe the losing bet is trying to work so hard to understand other people. Isn\u2019t it more effective to try to seek to understand yourself? So obviously everyone thinks different and is different, but I do think that maybe, by using yourself as your own magnifying glass, you could seek to understand all of humanity. Why? First, my honest belief is that humans are more similar than dissimilar. \ufffc and also human motivations and desires have not changed much from ancient Greece. So for example this is where I find that reading to Emily Wilson translations of the Elliot and now the odyssey are really really fascinating because it gives us better insight into maybe more core critical human values, human nature in general? My personal belief is that if you understand the route of human behavior action desires activity etc.\u2026 you kind of understand everything. For example, in the context of sociology\u2026 My greatest Boon to studying sociology was it was like my gateway drug to understanding all of human society, and also, individual human actions and activities. For example, sociology got me into psychology, which then got me into social media, social media marketing and blogging, and also\u2026 If history and travel and lifestyle, then philosophy, stoicism, Zen Zen Buddhism Taoism wabi sabi, ethics, aesthetics, and now the philosophy of money economics and bitcoin. What is the greatest moving force on the planet? Curiosity. Curiosity means what you care for. You cannot fake curiosity, nor can you force it. It is simply something that is natural innate, that which flows from within you. And I think that may be the root of curiosity is enthusiasm, a god dwelling within you. Also the same notion of having a purpose in life, a passion, all kind of a similar thing. I think it is not zero son; you can have more than one purpose in life, directive in life, imperative in life. But once again, assuming that like 90% of the world\u2019s problems are rooted in the economic, shouldn\u2019t the Y strategy be to try to seek to understand \u201cfix\u201d or at least address the economic question? I think when it comes down to it if you could just pinpoint one thing, it will always be 100% about the economy. it\u2019s the economy stupid! Carthage must burn! Capitalism economics, economic theory, it is all very critical. So currently I think the modern day economists are the ones who are being fed endowment checks from Ivy League universities from Harvard Yale etc., and everyone is giving them the big bucks because they\u2019re like the new modern day wizards or sorcerers. The general idea is if we could fund the economist to understand economic question, this will make the institution super super rich. I cannot speak for institutions because I am just an individual and human being. And my whole realm of care is pretty small; my sphere of concern is myself, Cindy and Seneca, my mom, my sister and her future family and that\u2019s pretty much it. This is my real family. So first, my first imperative was securing a glorious and splendid future for myself Cindy Seneca my mom in our future growing family. And everything is optimized around this. So from the get-go, I\u2019ve always only ever been interested in practical matters. Even the reason why I love Stoicism Zen and Taoism so much is that it actually applies to real reality. Even my interest in sociology was it was really really practical useful has real utility in the real world! I still will never forget my horrifying experience studying basic introduction to philosophy class in which the professor, tried to turn logical thinking into mathematics? This horrified me forever. Remember as an undergraduate, desiring to study philosophy, trying to figure out the meaning of life etc., and being stuck doing this insane mathematical equations? Maybe instead of goals, pathways are a more interesting idea. A Pak, pathway is kind of the general direction you tread, and go. And obviously there is a lot of flexibility which is possible here. And what are the ultimate goals? I think human human nature or at least for myself is about the zest of life of striving for more! For example, growth is a primary motivator to me. I\u2019ll give you example, increase overtime, yield overtime. For example, a very simple way to understand things for myself is that I like to see the number go up! Change over time brings me joy. \ufffc For example, in terms of bitcoin, finances and monetary yield, I\u2019d like to see the number go up, not down! Also with weightlifting, powerlifting one rep Max lifting etc., I love to see my one rep Max numbers go up! Even look at myself in the mirror, flexing my arms and biceps and seeing the growth of my biceps my triceps, my whole body. This brings me infinite joy, also seeing my body gaining a beautiful glow and bronze tan. Even the joy of getting a clean fresh haircut from Cindy. Makes me feel so great and handsome! Assuming that your life is about joy maximization, having kids wireless one kid seems to make the most sense. For example, Odysseus and his son; fighting together teaming up together, busting out the arrows and killing the suitors in hilarious fashion. What is it that Odysseus wanted? It was super simple, just to go back home! To go back to his home \ufffc in Ithaca, with his wife Penelope, and his son. To grow old in his own land, with his wealth. What are my personal goals? For myself, I want to stack the bitcoin into infinity and beyond. I want to buy it up all of it, . So I was doing some mathematics, and it came to my attention that my favorite neighborhood of all time is comprise of 340 plots of land. Each plot of land being worth at least 1 million or $1.1 million. So a simple mathematical equation is assuming that one plot of land is equivalent to one bitcoin, which means even right now\u2026 I believe the true worth of a bitcoin even in 2024 should be at least 1 million or $1.1 million. So if I was a super awesome capitalist, I would just buy up the whole neighborhood. All 340 plots of land. 17\u00d720 For example, each little square block in my neighborhood has about 20 single-family homes, or at least 20 lots of land. Each plot of land is subdivided into around 5000 ft.\u00b2. And then there is about 17 square blocks, so 340 is 17\u00d720. So let us break it down real estate, or property. Or a single-family home whatever. First, the goal is to own the land, how much land? you want to own the best land, the most prime land, in the most prime location, there is no second best. So for example, it is my personal belief that in all of America maybe, Culver City, Los Angeles, CA 90232 is like 100% the best city in America, maybe the planet. Why? Supreme weather, supreme infrastructure, and a relatively small and modest city which feels like a big town. I think of Culver City like travel town, also another railroad LA public park you got to check out with your kid. Anyways, I think the thing with physical land and zoning which is interesting is that I guess you could expand the zoning of a city in a province but still\u2026 Even if you expand it upwards, there will be some other spots some other epicenters which are superior to other ones. I think this is a really really difficult concept to grasp, probably one of the best nuggets of wisdom from Michael Saylor. So for example, the best or nothing.

New borrowings stood at N9.22tn, made up of both domestic and foreign borrowings.\n\u201cCapital expenditure is projected at N16.48tn with statutory transfers standing at N4.26tn and sinking funds projected at N430.27bn.\u201d       Related News  2025 budget: Senate threatens non-performing agencies  Senate, NADDC task automakers on backward integration  150,000bpd P\u2019Harcourt refinery plant 90% completed \u2013 NNPC   \nSpeaking during the debate on the report, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Senator Solomon Adeola (APC Ogun West) referenced the Federal Government\u2019s Compressed Natural Gas, CNG initiative as the underlying imperative for the adoption of the N1,400 to one dollar.\n\u201cWith the functioning of our refineries, the demand for Forex will drop.

The latest firm to make such a move is American Bitcoin miner Foundry. Based in Rochester, New York, Foundry confirmed that it has cut 16% of its staff. The company is one of the biggest U.S. Bitcoin miners.\u00a0 It said in a statement to Decrypt that it \u201cmade the difficult decision to reduce Foundry\u2019s workforce, resulting in layoffs across multiple teams.\u201d The firm added that it had also cut a small team in India. Blockspace first reported word of layoffs, though Foundry said a smaller number of roles were affected than originally claimed. \u201cWe recently made the strategic decision to focus Foundry on our core business\u2014operating the number-one Bitcoin mining pool in the world and growing our site operations business\u2014while we supported the development of DCG\u2019s newest subsidiaries, including Yuma and the spinout of Foundry\u2019s successful self-mining business,\u201d it said in a statement.\u00a0 Yuma is an artificial intelligence (AI) platform and Foundry subsidiary. Digital Currency Group (DCG), which owns Foundry, said in a letter to shareholders after the U.S. election that its mining operation would work best as a \u201cstandalone business.\u201d Foundry also provides staking services for other digital assets like Ethereum. Despite surging crypto prices, major companies across the space\u2014including Ethereum giant Consensys, top digital asset exchange Kraken, and New York platform dYdX\u2014have cut headcount this year. Experts told Decrypt before the election that regulatory uncertainty played a part in companies slimming down.\u00a0 Bitcoin mining is a particularly difficult industry. Rewards for miners get slashed every four years, and it becomes more expensive for companies to run their businesses. Bitcoin mining is the process of using powerful computers to verify transactions on the biggest crypto network.\u00a0 Back in the day, over 14 years ago, it was possible to do the process on a home PC. But as the network has grown, so has the industry\u2014and the competition. Miners are typically now large operations using server farms and a lot of electricity. Miners receive newly minted Bitcoins for their work, and as the years go by, the process of producing coins becomes more difficult\u2014and even more energy-consuming. However, JP Morgan said that Bitcoin mining revenue grew in November amid the surging price of BTC, which came within a few hundred dollars of the $100,000 mark for the first time late last month.

Managed by Fortlake\u2014recently named Fixed Income Manager of the Year in Australia\u2014 the fund\u2019s units will be transformed into digital tokens, a process called tokenization, where real-world assets (RWAs) are represented on a blockchain, the companies announced exclusively to Decrypt.\u00a0 The collaborations seek to simplify asset management by bringing traditional financial assets on-chain and expanding access to decentralized finance (DeFi). The trio believes the fund\u2019s tokenization leads to new opportunities within DeFi, \u201csuch as integrations with lending markets, use as a high-yield stablecoin savings solution, or as margin trading collateral.\u201d \u201cPartnering with Backed, Sonic, and Chainlink to tokenize the Sigma Opportunities Fund is a substantial development in the way we provide access to our fund for the rapidly growing digital asset investor base,\u201d Christian Baylis, founder and CIO of Fortlake said in a statement. \u201cWe believe this collaboration marks the beginning of a new era in traditional asset management fundraising.\u201d As a global fixed-income investment strategy targeting high yield, the fund targets returns between 7 and 10%, according to Fortlake\u2019s own product disclosure statement. Fortlake has over $1 billion in assets under management across all of its funds. Tokenization will occur using Backed\u2019s Tokenization-as-a-Service (TaaS) platform. Those tokens will be backed 1:1 by units, ensuring their value corresponds to the real-time Net Asset Value (NAV) of the fund\u2014essentially the fund\u2019s worth per share. \u201cTokenizing the Fortlake Sigma Fund is a major step forward in the blockchain landscape,\u201d said Adam Levi, co-founder of Backed. \u201cIt showcases how institutions can use blockchain technology to simplify back-office operations and reach new capital.\u201d The tokens will then be integrated into the Sonic blockchain, a platform capable of processing 10,000 transactions per second with one-second finality. Chainlink\u2019s SmartData technology also ensures the fund\u2019s value is accurately recorded on the blockchain, the trio said. Chainlink\u2019s Proof of Reserves feature verifies that the fund always backs the tokens, so investors know their assets are secure. Chainlink also uses CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) to allow these tokens to work across multiple blockchains. The partnership points to the growing interest in blockchain-based solutions for asset management.\u00a0 Recently, stablecoin issuer Tether launched Hadron, a tokenization platform for digital and real-world assets that lets users tokenize various assets, from stocks and bonds to stablecoins and loyalty points. A few weeks back, Japan\u2019s SBI Digital Markets announced it is developing a cross-border framework for tokenized assets, connecting regulated digital asset exchanges across multiple regions to boost liquidity and lower costs. With institutions like BlackRock and JP Morgan exploring tokenization, the Bank of America predicts the sector could reach $16 trillion in value within the next 15 years. \"The future of tokenization is accelerating toward greater institutional adoption,\" Jakob Kronbichler, CEO and co-founder of DeFi credit marketplace Clearpool, told Decrypt. \"While tokenized treasuries and stablecoins currently dominate RWA use cases, the future promises growing traction in real estate, private credit, and other asset classes like commodities.\" Edited by Sebastian Sinclair Editor's note: This story was updated after publication to update the amount of assets under management at Fortlake.

Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy. While Amazon has been investing $8 billion into the artificial intelligence (AI) company Anthropic, which started the chatbot Claude, it\u2019s been quietly building its own models to compete with it and OpenAI\u2019s Dall-E and Sora. \nAmazon chief executive Andy Jassy announced six new AI foundation models at Amazon Web Services'\nannual re:Invent conference in Las Vegas.\n \u201cHave at it, giddy up.\u201d Jassy said to finalise the reveal of six new models to the market, called Amazon Nova. The new products included an image generation model called Amazon Nova Canvas, and a video generation model, Amazon Nova Reel, which both had content moderation built in. The video model would begin generating 6-second-long videos and grow to make 2-minute videos within months, Jassy said. The models would all be about 75% cheaper than competitor models available on Amazon Web Services\u2019 (AWS) Bedrock platform, he said. Five of the models were available immediately but its most complex model, Amazon Nova Premier, was still in development and would be released in 2025. Currently, AWS allowed customers to use any AI model available on Bedrock, including its existing model Amazon Q and competitor models from Meta\u2019s Llama, Mistral AI and Anthropic\u2019s Claude. \u201cWe think we\u2019ve added some pretty interesting models.\u201d Jassy said. \u201cBut you can use them in any combination you want. \u201cWe will give you that choice and selection.\u201d Jassy said AWS would now focus on developing the second generation of these AI models, while also building more. It was working on a speech-to-speech model and a model that would allow any mode of input and produce any mode of output - what he called an any-to-any model. \u201cSo you\u2019ll be able to input text, speech, images or video and output text, speech, images or video. \u201cThis is the future of how frontier models are going to built and be consumed.\u201d AWS doubled its investment in AI developer Anthropic this year to US$8 billion - Jassy alluded to those relationships remaining intact, despite its increased competitiveness. \u201cWe are going to give you the broadest and best functionality you can find anywhere. \u201cIt\u2019s going to mean choice.\u201d AWS chief executive Matt Garman said it was still the early days of generative artificial intelligence applications. \u201cGenerative AI has the potential to transform every single industry, every single company out there.\u201d Garman said at re:Invent. However, demand for data storage had already surged, as enterprises looked to adopt AI. \u201cIf every application needs compute ... Of course every application needs storage, because that\u2019s where your data lives.\u201d AWS launched its first storage service in 2006, meaning it had been leading the global shift to moving information into external data centres, aka \u201cthe cloud\u201d, for 18 years. A decade ago, AWS had fewer than 100 customers storing more than a petabyte of data, now it had thousands of customers storing that much data. Some large customers, such as JP Morgan Chase, were storing an exabyte of data. In recent years, AWS' AI efforts had seen it launch its own machine-learning computer chips and partner with Nvidia. AWS' managing director for Australia and New Zealand Rianne van Veldhuizen said the new Nova models would be available to customers in New Zealand and Australia.  She said the technology company built the new Nova models because customers were asking for them.  \u201cOur customers consistently tell us they want increased model choice and more options that are also cost effective.  \u201cThat\u2019s why we are adding Amazon Nova models to what is already the largest selection of Gen[erative] AI models available in Amazon Bedrock.  \u201cToday\u2019s news is big but it\u2019s just day one, and we\u2019re in it for the long term.  \u201cWe believe Amazon is in the best position to democratise the benefits of generative AI to every business globally.\u201d She said AWS' announcement was a significant leap forward in its AI journey. \u201cOur new Amazon Nova models represent an exciting opportunity for local organisations to harness the power of generative AI to experiment, innovate, and easily scale.\u201d Stay tuned for more details on Amazon\u2019s AI strategy on Markets with Madison next week.

Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis will open the conference and participate in a closed roundtable discussion with institutional investors, followed by a discussion with Morgan Stanley representatives Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis will open the conference and participate in a closed roundtable discussion with institutional investors, followed by a discussion with Morgan Stanley representatives. The investors in Athens are awaiting the prime minister\u2019s official position when asked about the rumors that have circulated in Athens\u2019 stock exchange offices about possible taxation of banks\u2019 profits, a fact that seems to be denied by sources close to the prime minister. The prime minister will be accompanied in London by the head of his Economic Office, Alexis Patellis, who will also participate in a discussion with Morgan Stanley analysts. Within the framework of the two-day conference, three thematic panel discussions will also be held that will focus on Greek banks, the energy sector and the Athens Stock Exchange. The Greek government is placing great emphasis on developing policies that are pro-investment and an environment that will be attractive to strong international capital. The government\u2019s aim is to restructure and strengthen the domestic stock market in order to support and develop businesses through the smooth flow of capital. Foreign funds are expected to show particular interest in energy companies, especially with regard to the country\u2019s transition to a lower-emissions mix. Greece has relied on lignite for decades, while the transition has been implemented over the last two decades, through a mix of natural gas, wind farms and photovoltaics.

It remains unknown how such decisions are made when these preferences are inaccessible or disrupted, as might be the case for individuals confronting novel options or experiencing cognitive impairment. Thus, we examined participants with lesions in insular or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, key regions implicated in risky decision-making, as they played a gambling task where choices were made both alone and after observing others\u2019 choices. Participants in both lesion groups showed disrupted use of standard utility-based computations about risky options. For socially situated decisions, these participants showed increased conformity with the choices of others, independent from social utility-based computations. These findings suggest that in social contexts, following others\u2019 choices may be a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based risk processing is disrupted. When humans make decisions in social situations, we typically weigh both our individual preferences and information about what others choose. There are also common circumstances where individual preferences may be unavailable (e.g., when encountering new options or for individuals with certain neuropsychiatric conditions). To understand how choices are made in a social context when individual preferences are unavailable, we evaluated individuals with lesions in brain regions that encode risk preferences while these individuals made risky choices both independently and after viewing others\u2019 choices. We find that when individual risk preferences are not computed, participants use a cognitive shortcut of making the same choices that others make. This shortcut may explain the heightened influence of others on the choices of some vulnerable individuals. Citation: Orloff MA, Chung D, Gu X, Wang X, Gao Z, Song G, et al.

Competing interests:  The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. In social contexts, decision-makers sometimes follow a crowd despite their own preferences toward a different course of action [1,2]. This phenomenon has been documented in various forms in humans [3] and in nonhuman primates [4]. Recent studies indicate that when making socially situated choices, humans combine individual preferences for the options at stake with individual valuation of social information; contributions from each of these determine when choices made in a social context diverge (or not) from that which one\u2019s preferences outside a social context would predict [5\u201311]. These previous studies have largely focused on understanding how social information contributes to choices with respect to individuals\u2019 preferences about risk. Here, we investigated how risky decisions in social contexts are made when utility-based risk preferences are disrupted or inaccessible, as might be the case for individuals with certain psychopathologies or who are confronting novel options (e.g., Gershman & Niv [12]). Specifically, previous literature on decision-making in humans and non-human primates indicates that when individuals have a limited amount of private information, they tend to use various cognitive shortcuts or heuristics (e.g., mimicking other agents) to simplify decision processes [13\u201316]. In the current study, we use a risky decision-making task and examine whether such heuristics facilitate socially situated decision-making about risk when utility processing is disrupted. Previous work has shown that individual preferences and information from others are combined during risky decision-making under social influence [7,8,11,17]. Neurally, the insular and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices (dACC) have been shown to encode an interaction between one\u2019s own risk preference and information from others. As such, these regions show greater hemodynamic responses when an individual\u2019s preference differs from the observed choices of others [8]. The insula and dACC have also been consistently implicated in decision-making about risky options in non-social contexts, via lesion (insula only), functional neuroimaging (insula and dACC), and electrophysiology (insula) studies [18\u201323]. Thus, in situations where the structural or functional integrity of these regions is disrupted (e.g., in some neurological or psychiatric disorders) or where insufficient information or differing abilities impose constraints, individual computations and decisions about risky options may be disrupted, leaving open the question of how socially informed decision-making occurs in those cases. To examine this question, we administered a gambling task in both social and non-social contexts to individuals with focal insula or dACC lesions and tested models that measured the degree to which utility-based or heuristic-based processes were implemented during decision-making. Individuals with focal insula (N = 10) or dACC lesions (N = 6) and non-lesioned control participants (NCs; N = 28) made a series of choices between pairs of gambles alone (\u2018Solo\u2019 trials) and after observing two others\u2019 choices (\u2018Info\u2019 trials; Fig 1A\u20131C; task developed in our previous work [7,8]). Trials comprised four distinct types: Solo, where participants did not see others\u2019 choices; Info: \u2018safe\u2019, in which both of the two social others\u2019 choices that the participant observed were the safer (i.e., lower payoff variance) gamble; Info: \u2018risky\u2019, in which the two social others\u2019 choices were the riskier (i.e., higher payoff variance) gamble; and Info: \u2018mix\u2019, where one social other\u2019s choice was the safer gamble, and one other\u2019s choice was the riskier gamble. Info and Solo trials were intermixed throughout the task. (a) Participants made a series of choices between one \u2018safer\u2019 gamble and one \u2018riskier\u2019 gamble. On each trial, participants viewed a new pair of gambles. On some trials, participants made choices alone (Solo trials). On other trials, they were asked to make choices after observing two other players\u2019 choices (Info trials). The Info trials had three different types based on the composition of the two other players\u2019 choices: \u2018safe, safe,\u2019 \u2018risky, risky,\u2019 and \u2018mix.\u2019 Four trial types (Solo, Info: \u2018safe\u2019, Info: \u2018risky\u2019, and Info: \u2018mix\u2019) were intermixed. Reconstructions of (b) dACC (N = 6) and (c) insula (N = 10) lesions are shown. The color bar represents the degree of lesion overlap among patients. To show the lesion overlap across participants, all lesions are shown overlaid on one hemisphere. (d) Power utility model fit for Solo trials as measured by negative log likelihood (\u2212LL; lower values indicate a better fit) shows that individuals with insula or dACC lesions had significantly worse model fit than non-lesion control participants (NCs; P = 0.0072; NC vs insula: P = 0.032; NC vs dACC: P = 0.073), suggesting disrupted utility-based risky decision-making in participants with insula or dACC lesions; see also S1 Fig for model-agnostic data consistent with disrupted sensitivity to risk in lesion participants).\n (a) Participants made a series of choices between one \u2018safer\u2019 gamble and one \u2018riskier\u2019 gamble.

Per economic utility theory [24], individuals\u2019 preferences about risk can be captured by the concavity (\u03c1) of power utility functions (U(x) = x\u03c1) that reflect individuals\u2019 utility computations about risky options. We thus used a goodness-of-fit metric of the power utility model for explaining individual participants\u2019 decisions about risky options as an indication of the extent to which utility-based decision-making was used. Specifically, we used the median negative log likelihood as it reflects the fit at the median parameter estimates which we use throughout the paper (see Methods: Behavioral model specifications and model comparison). As expected, participants with insula or dACC lesions showed worse model fit compared with NCs [i.e., comparisons of negative log likelihood (\u2212LL) in Solo trials, P = 0.0072; see also [18\u201321] reporting insula or dACC involvement in utility-based decision-making under risk. This remained true after controlling for individuals\u2019 risk preference (P = 0.0019). Post-hoc analyses by lesion area indicated that compared with NCs, participants with insula lesions showed worse model fit while participants with dACC lesions trended toward worse model fit (P = 0.032 and P = 0.073, respectively; Fig 1d; see Materials and Methods for full details and S1 Fig for model-agnostic choice behaviors). Participants with insula lesions and participants with dACC lesions did not differ in model fit (P = 0.87, Bayes factor (BFnull) = 2.27). Using these participants with insula or dACC lesions as exemplars, we next sought to examine whether heuristics may facilitate socially situated decision-making when utility-based risk processing is disrupted. Previously, we developed an \u2018other-conferred utility (OCU)\u2019 model and showed that the impact of social information on decisions about risky options is captured by increased utility to the option chosen by others and thus, increased likelihood of choosing this option [8]; we refer to this type of social information use as \u2018OCU-based\u2019 or \u2018utility-based.\u2019 This model, along with its modified version, has been validated in independent simulations showing both model and parameter recovery [7,26]. Here, to accommodate the possibility of incorporating social information into decisions independent of utility computations (i.e., \u2018heuristic-based\u2019 or \u2018OCU-free\u2019 use of social information), we extend our previous OCU model [8] and introduce weight parameters that allow a mixture between OCU-based and OCU-free contributions of social information to participants\u2019 decisions (\u2018hybrid model\u2019 hereafter). The OCU-free parameters allow the initial testing of zeroth order social heuristics that have been previously shown to affect decision-making [13]; in the present work, these choices are either in alignment with or in opposition to the choices made by others [8,9]. We subsequently call these choices that \u2018follow\u2019 or \u2018oppose,\u2019 respectively, those of social others. In this mixture model, weight parameters \u03c9utility, \u03c9follow, and \u03c9oppose capture the degree to which social information is incorporated into decision-making, dependent upon (\u03c9utility) or independent from (\u03c9follow and \u03c9oppose) social utility-based processes (Figs 2, S2, S3, and S4 for further model description and validation information). Note that if an individual uses social information in a way that fully relies on other-conferred utility (i.e., \u03c9utility = 1), the mixture model prediction is equivalent to that of the original OCU model [8]; if an individual uses social information in a manner that is fully free from other-conferred utility (OCU-free; i.e., \u03c9follow + \u03c9oppose = 1), their choices would be consistent with the simple heuristics of fully following or opposing those of social others, regardless of the gamble options. See S5 Fig for model comparison of the hybrid model against an only OCU-free heuristic model, an only OCU-based model, and a Solo risk preference model, showing best fit of the hybrid model for explaining participants\u2019 choices. The hybrid model uses two weights (\u03c9follow and \u03c9oppose) to represent utility\u2013independent contributions of social information to participant decisions, indexing the degree to which participants follow or oppose the choices of social others, independent from utility-based risk processing. (a) Effectively, the \u2018follow\u2019 and \u2018oppose\u2019 weights act to constrain the probability of choosing a given option. On Info: \u2018safe\u2019 trials, the maximum probability of choosing the safe option (regardless of any gamble information) is equivalent to 1 \u2013\u03c9oppose (shown as the dotted red lines for different \u03c9oppose values) while the minimum probability of choosing the safe option (regardless of any gamble information) is equivalent to \u03c9follow (shown as the dotted green line). Likewise, on Info: \u2018risky\u2019 trials (not depicted), the maximum probability of choosing the safe option is 1 \u2013\u03c9follow, and the minimum probability of choosing the safe option is \u03c9oppose. The black lines represent the other-conferred utility process, setting the probability of choosing the safe option as a function of gamble information transformed by one\u2019s risk preference (according to a power utility function), sensitivity to utility (softmax choice rule), and subjective value conferred by others choosing a particular option (other-conferred utility; OCU). (b) In constructing this model, we remained agnostic as to whether oppose and follow represent dissociable processes. Nonetheless, after model estimation, we further tested if there was a relationship between these oppose and follow processes. We find no significant correlation between \u03c9follow and \u03c9oppose when measured across all participants (Pearson\u2019s r = \u20130.11, P = 0.47, robust correlation, BFnull = 6.52), suggesting dissociable processes for individuals\u2019 decisions to follow or oppose social others\u2019 choices. Each point represents an individual participant, and lines are the regressions between the indicated parameters.\n The hybrid model uses two weights (\u03c9follow and \u03c9oppose) to represent utility\u2013independent contributions of social information to participant decisions, indexing the degree to which participants follow or oppose the choices of social others, independent from utility-based risk processing. (a) Effectively, the \u2018follow\u2019 and \u2018oppose\u2019 weights act to constrain the probability of choosing a given option. On Info: \u2018safe\u2019 trials, the maximum probability of choosing the safe option (regardless of any gamble information) is equivalent to 1 \u2013\u03c9oppose (shown as the dotted red lines for different \u03c9oppose values) while the minimum probability of choosing the safe option (regardless of any gamble information) is equivalent to \u03c9follow (shown as the dotted green line). Likewise, on Info: \u2018risky\u2019 trials (not depicted), the maximum probability of choosing the safe option is 1 \u2013\u03c9follow, and the minimum probability of choosing the safe option is \u03c9oppose. The black lines represent the other-conferred utility process, setting the probability of choosing the safe option as a function of gamble information transformed by one\u2019s risk preference (according to a power utility function), sensitivity to utility (softmax choice rule), and subjective value conferred by others choosing a particular option (other-conferred utility; OCU). (b) In constructing this model, we remained agnostic as to whether oppose and follow represent dissociable processes. Nonetheless, after model estimation, we further tested if there was a relationship between these oppose and follow processes. We find no significant correlation between \u03c9follow and \u03c9oppose when measured across all participants (Pearson\u2019s r = \u20130.11, P = 0.47, robust correlation, BFnull = 6.52), suggesting dissociable processes for individuals\u2019 decisions to follow or oppose social others\u2019 choices. Each point represents an individual participant, and lines are the regressions between the indicated parameters. \n              https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1012602.g002 Compared with non-lesion controls, participants with insula or dACC lesions as a combined group showed significantly larger following weights (\u03c9follow; Fig 3A; P = 0.014). This group difference result remained consistent after controlling for individuals\u2019 risk preference (P = 0.0074). Post-hoc analyses by lesion area indicated that relative to the non-lesion controls, participants with insula lesions (P = 0.036) and with dACC lesions (P = 0.025) also both showed significantly larger \u03c9follow. These results indicate that individuals with focal lesions in insula or dACC implement a \u2018follow others\u2019 choices\u2019 heuristic during decision-making in a social context, which behaviorally manifests as increased conformity with the choices of others. Model-agnostic measures of participants\u2019 tendency to follow the choices of others were correlated with the model-derived \u03c9follow (S2C and S2D Fig; for complete mixture model details, see S2A Fig). Tendencies for choices to oppose those of social others (captured in the \u03c9oppose parameter) did not differ between participants with insula or dACC lesions and controls (Fig 3B, P = 0.20, BFnull = 1.64). A post-hoc analysis additionally shows comparable \u03c9oppose parameters between insula lesion and dACC lesion groups (P = 0.28, BFnull = 1.48). As we hypothesized, participants with insula or dACC lesions, relative to non-lesion control participants, had diminished \u03c9utility (Fig 3C; P = 0.0041), indicating less use of utility-based risk processing. This remained the case after controlling for individuals\u2019 risk preference (P = 0.0018). Post-hoc analyses by lesion area indicated that participants with insula lesions had diminished \u03c9utility (P = 0.0043); participants with dACC lesions did not differ from control participants or participants with insula lesions (dACC vs NCs: P = 0.14, BFnull = 1.17; dACC vs insula: P = 0.36, BFnull = 1.71). See S3 Fig for individual \u03c9 estimates and further examination of model weights. (a) Parameter estimates across all trials showed that individuals with insula or dACC lesions had significantly larger \u03c9follow estimates than non-lesioned control participants (NC; NC vs insula: P = 0.036; NC vs dACC: P = 0.025; dACC vs insula: P = 0.89, BFnull = 2.28), indicating that the lesion participants were more likely to conform with others\u2019 choices during decision-making in a social context. (b) The insula and dACC lesion groups\u2019 \u03c9oppose estimates were comparable to NC estimates. (c) NC participants had larger \u03c9utility estimates than individuals with lesions (P = 0.0041). Post-hoc analyses revealed that the difference was specific to individuals with insula lesions (NC vs insula: P = 0.0043; NC vs dACC: P = 0.14, BFnull = 1.17; dACC vs insula: P = 0.36, BFnull = 1.71). (d) We tested a link between decreased utility-based risk processing (measured by negative log likelihood in Solo trials; \u2212LL) and increased \u03c9follow. Across all groups, individuals with worse utility-model fit (larger \u2212LL) in Solo trials showed greater \u03c9follow (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.52, P = 2.7e\u221204, robust correlation).\n (a) Parameter estimates across all trials showed that individuals with insula or dACC lesions had significantly larger \u03c9follow estimates than non-lesioned control participants (NC; NC vs insula: P = 0.036; NC vs dACC: P = 0.025; dACC vs insula: P = 0.89, BFnull = 2.28), indicating that the lesion participants were more likely to conform with others\u2019 choices during decision-making in a social context.

(d) We tested a link between decreased utility-based risk processing (measured by negative log likelihood in Solo trials; \u2212LL) and increased \u03c9follow. Across all groups, individuals with worse utility-model fit (larger \u2212LL) in Solo trials showed greater \u03c9follow (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.52, P = 2.7e\u221204, robust correlation). \n              https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1012602.g003 If individuals with impairments in utility-based risky decision-making indeed rely on conformity to a greater extent, we may expect a parametric relationship between degree of impairment and use of the \u2018follow others\u2019 choices\u2019 heuristic. In this case, across both lesion and control groups, individuals who are most disrupted in utility-based risky decision-making would be expected to show greater use of this heuristic when making decisions under risk in a social context. To evaluate this possibility, we used model fit (negative log likelihood; \u2212LL) calculated for choices in Solo trials (data presented in Fig 1D) as a measure of disruption in utility-based risky decision-making and examined the association of model fit with individuals\u2019 model-derived following weights (\u03c9follow). Across all three groups, individuals\u2019 tendencies to follow the choices of social others (\u03c9follow) were significantly correlated with greater \u2212LL in Solo trials (greater \u2212LL indicating more disrupted utility-based risk processing; Pearson\u2019s r = 0.52, P = 2.7e\u221204, robust correlation; Fig 3D). This relationship was consistent after controlling for individuals\u2019 risk preference (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.52, P = 3.0e\u221204, robust correlation). That is, individuals whose utility-based risky decision-making was most disrupted conformed the most with the choices of others. This relationship was replicated in an independent sample of control participants (S5B Fig), providing convergent evidence supporting the notion that there is a trade-off between utility-based processes and cognitively less demanding heuristics that facilitates decisions about risky options in a social context. Humans use social information in different ways to guide decision-making [27,28]. The present results provide a model-based explanation for how in social situations, individuals with disrupted utility-based risk processing may make choices about risky options. Using individuals with insula or dACC lesions as exemplars, we show that these individuals exhibit disrupted utility-based risk processing and use social information independent from utility computation to guide decisions about risky options. These findings suggest social conformity can serve as a heuristic alternative to using social information in a utility-based way during socially situated decision-making when individuals\u2019 risk processing is impaired. In previous studies using the same task, we have shown that when making decisions under risk, individuals combine social information with personal preferences and do so by adding other-conferred utility to the option that others choose [7,8]. Here, we identify an alternative heuristic path of using the same type of social information when personal preferences are not computed. This discovery was made possible by examining participants with lesions in insula and dACC (regions that have been consistently implicated in functional neuroimaging studies of risk processing) as exemplars of individuals with disrupted risk processing [18,19,29,30]. Our post-hoc analyses examined whether insula and dACC participants differed with regard to disruptions in risk processing; we found no evidence of group differences between insula and dACC participants in power-utility model fit to their choices on Solo trials. While to our knowledge, this work is among the first to show evidence of disrupted risk processing in participants with dACC lesions, it is perhaps unsurprising, given that dACC and insula frequently co-activate in functional neuroimaging studies of risk-related decision-making [18,19,29,30]. We also considered our work in the context of prior work implicating dMFC (often extending into dACC) in social processes [7,26,31\u201333]; while we did not observe social-specific differences in our dACC vs insula participants, this is an area of relevant future study. We emphasize that the \u2018follow others\u2019 choices\u2019 heuristic identified in the current study is consistent with a \u2018copy-when-uncertain\u2019 strategy previously demonstrated in perceptual decision-making, such that individuals are more likely to rely on the behaviors of others when they are less confident about their own decisions [34\u201336]. The present study adds to this literature by demonstrating that a copy-when-uncertain strategy extends to socially situated decision-making about risky options. Of note, although a \u2018follow others\u2019 choices\u2019 heuristic seems qualitatively different from utility-based use of social information, one framework that captures both paths is a Bayesian-like update framework, in which individuals use social information to update their likelihood of choosing the safe gamble [37\u201340]. That is, the utility difference between gamble options may serve as a Bayesian prior, updated by novel information contained in social others\u2019 choices. The extent to which an individual combines their priors with the novel social information depends on the relative uncertainty between the gamble utility difference and the social information where the information with lower uncertainty contributes more to the final decision (i.e., the posterior). In this framework, individuals who have disrupted utility-based risky decision-making (e.g., the lesion group herein) would be expected to have a relatively flat prior for the utility difference of gamble options. Starting with this flat prior, a Bayesian process would indicate that any subsequent choices made under social influence would be primarily driven by the social information because the social information carries more certainty than does the individuals\u2019 computed utility difference between the choices at hand. By comparison, individuals with intact utility-based risk processing (e.g., NCs) would have relatively sharper priors for utility differences between gambles and the social information would subsequently carry less impact for participants\u2019 decisions. Broadly, these results have important implications for circumstances associated with suboptimal risky decision-making, such as during neurodevelopment in adolescents [41,42] or in individuals with neurological and psychiatric disorders characterized by altered decision-making [43\u201346]. This disrupted utility-based risk processing may in-turn play a role in the particularly prominent influence of social others in adolescent decision-making [47,48] and also in the onset and maintenance of substance misuse and related psychopathology [49,50]. In these cases, disruption to utility-based risk processing may lead to heightened influence of other people in socially situated decision-making. The presence of heuristic and utility-based processes for incorporating information from social others into risky decision-making thus suggests distinct avenues for addressing maladaptive decision-making (e.g., enhancing preferences vs changing social group composition). The limitations of the present study suggest some avenues for future investigations. First, although the information being shown to participants in this study is social information (i.e., choices of others), it is possible that influences on participant choices may be due to a more general visual or information effect, whereby merely seeing other information (regardless of its source) may influence behavioral choices. While we previously demonstrated in non-lesioned adults using the same task that effects on participants\u2019 behavior was indeed \u2018social\u2019 (i.e., no influence on participants choices were observed in a non-social visually controlled experiment; Supplemental Fig 8 from [8]), this may not extend to individuals with insula and\/or dACC lesions. Further work is necessary to test whether the \u2018follow others\u2019 choices\u2019 effect when risk processing is disrupted is specific to social information or more general to any type of information. Second, we combined participants with dACC or insula lesions into a single \u2018lesion group\u2019 because of the common role of these regions in risk processing [18\u201323] and to maximize power for our primary intention of examining socially situated decision-making under risk. Still, it is worth noting the unique roles of these regions in other cognitive processes. For example, dACC is strongly implicated in social cognition [28] and social learning [51], while insula is more strongly implicated in interoception [52]. Future studies with larger samples ought to examine specificity of foci in these regions against more nuanced decision-making models and distinct social cognitive processes. We might expect relatively stronger impairment in social information processing in individuals with dACC lesions (and potentially stronger use of heuristics), whereas we might see stronger effects of risk processing (where interoception is thought to be a key component [53]) or dissociation of different risk models (e.g., [54]) in those with insula lesions. Third, we note that the perceptual \u2018copy when uncertain\u2019 strategy has exceptions (e.g., [55]) and similarly, the use of a \u2018follow others\u2019 choices\u2019 heuristic may not be universally implemented in individuals for whom utility-based risk preferences may be disrupted, inaccessible, or otherwise not present (e.g., during substance misuse, individuals with certain psychopathologies, adolescents confronting novel options). We look forward to future studies examining these possibilities. Lastly, we point out that the model comparison analyses indicate that the Hybrid model was not well dissociable from the OCU-based, OCU-free, and Solo RP models, perhaps due in part to the nested nature of these models or the presence of multiple overlapping processes during socially-situated decision making about risky options. While our primary findings are based on robust parameter estimates of heuristic processes within the Hybrid model, the model comparison analyses indicate that the Hybrid model alone is unlikely to capture the range of social influences on risky decision-making; future studies are necessary to implement study designs that allow these processes to be detangled (see S4 Fig for further discussion). Social contexts affect the decisions we make [56] and information received from others governs if and how one\u2019s decisions are influenced by social others [57, 8]. Administering a risky decision-making task to participants with insula or dACC lesions revealed contributions of social information to decision-making that are independent from those relying on individuals\u2019 utility-based computations about risk. Our model-based analytic approach and lesion data point to social conformity as a heuristic alternative in the absence of deliberative utility-based computation, during socially-situated decision making about risky options. All participants provided written informed consent and were paid for their participation. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Virginia Tech and Tiantan Hospital of Capital University of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China. Forty-six neurologically intact non-lesioned control (NC) subjects (male\/female = 27\/19, age = 44.28\u00b17.63), 11 with focal insula lesions (male\/female = 5\/6, age = 44.00\u00b111.85), and 13 with focal dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) lesions (male\/female = 8\/5, age = 38.38\u00b111.43) participated in the current study. All participants reported no previous or current psychiatric conditions; all controls reported no previous or current neurological conditions. All participants with lesions were recruited from the Patient\u2019s Registry of Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Beijing, China. NCs were recruited in local Beijing communities and were matched with patients for age, sex, and education. Participants who showed choices that met a priori\u2013defined behavioral exclusion criteria were excluded from all analyses. Specifically, 11 NCs, one participant with an insula lesion, and three participants with dACC lesions who chose the option with greater high payoff value less frequently as the probability of winning increased (comparing average gamble choices between winning probabilities of 40% to 90%) were excluded. Seven NCs and two participants with dACC lesions who always chose the safer or riskier gamble on all 24 Solo trials were additionally excluded. These exclusionary criteria are necessary to ensure that there are enough trials for accurate parameter estimation and that the assumptions underlying model estimation are met. We note that we excluded these participants from estimation because for participants who choose all risky or all safe, bi-directional social influence is not possible. That is, participants who always chose the risky option cannot be influenced to make riskier choices; similarly, participants who always chose the safe option cannot be influenced to make safer decisions. Finally, two additional participants from the dACC lesion group whose lesions were not localized within the dACC region were excluded from all analyses. Therefore, the analyzed sample included 28 NCs (male\/female = 17\/11, age = 42.82 \u00b1 8.09), 10 participants with insula lesions (male\/female = 4\/6, age = 43.10 \u00b1 12.09), and 6 participants with dACC lesions (male\/female = 4\/2, age = 34.33 \u00b1 6.74; see S7 Fig for evaluation and confirmation of our main results across different exclusion criteria and further discussion). Groups were well matched in sex (P = 0.59; NC vs insula: P = 0.28; NC vs dACC: P = 0.80; dACC vs insula: P = 0.34), lesion laterality (P = 0.54), education (P = 0.18; NC vs insula: P = 0.18; NC vs dACC: P = 0.34; dACC vs insula: P = 0.97), days since surgery (P = 0.37), lesion size (P = 0.92), and handedness (P = 0.74; NC vs insula: P = 0.44; NC vs dACC: P = 0.14; dACC vs insula: P = 0.12). Age was comparable between lesion and control groups (P = 0.31), between NCs and participants with insula lesions (P = 0.93) and between the two lesion groups (P = 0.13), whereas those with dACC lesions were significantly younger than NCs (P = 0.024). The lesion group had significantly lower Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE [58]) scores than NCs (P = 0.0005; NC vs insula: P = 0.0013; NC vs dACC: P = 0.0091). However, the two lesion groups had comparable MMSE scores (P = 0.97). Because MMSE and age were different between at least one lesion group and NCs, we examined whether disrupted utility-based risky decision-making (Fig 1D) still differed between the lesion group and NCs after accounting for variation due to these demographics and whether the correlation between model fit and social heuristic remained significant (Fig 3D). Specifically, we first regressed out age or MMSE in separate multiple linear regression models and then performed either a group comparison or robust correlation test on those residuals to confirm lesion group or omega follow, respectively remained a significant predictor of disruption in utility-based risky decision-making. Indeed the lesion group was a significant predictor of disruption in utility-based risky decision-making after regressing out either age (P = 0.0072) or MMSE (P = 0.0094) and omega follow was significantly correlated with disruption in utility-based risky decision-making after regressing out either age (r = 0.46, P = 0.0016) or MMSE (r = 0.43, P = 0.0038) (Table 1).  \n              https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1012602.t001 Lesion reconstruction was performed by a research assistant who was blind to the study design and behavioral results (C.T.) and was confirmed by a senior researcher (X.G.). In brief, lesions evident on T1- and T2- weighted MRI scans were identified and transcribed onto corresponding sections of a template to create a volume of interest (.voi) file. The template was derived from an MRI volume of a normal control (ch2.nii) created by Christopher Rorden (University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC) and provided for use with MRIcron [59]. This.voi file was used to measure the location (MNI coordinates) and volume (in ml) of individual lesions and to create within group overlaps of multiple lesions using the MRIcron program. Participants were asked to make a series of choices between two risky gambles alone (Solo trials) and after observing others\u2019 choices (Info trials) (Fig 1A) [8]. In each pair of gambles, one gamble was always riskier than the other gamble; the two gambles had the same high- and low- payoff probabilities, but the riskier gamble had greater payoff variance. Participants were instructed that they were playing within a group of five others and that two other players\u2019 choices would be randomly selected and shown on some trials. To ensure participants\u2019 understanding, a brief quiz was administered following the task instruction and any erroneous answers were addressed. Unbeknownst to participants, for the purpose of the current study, Info trials were drawn without replacement from a uniform distribution that comprised equal numbers of trials where both other players chose the safe gamble (Info: \u2018safe\u2019), both others chose the risky gamble (Info: \u2018risky\u2019), or one player chose the safe and the other player chose the risky gamble (Info: \u2018mix\u2019). Gambles used in the current study were developed to optimally observe risky decision-making under social influence, as detailed in Chung et al. [8]. In brief, we developed eight unique lottery menus adapted from Holt and Laury [60]. For each participant, four lottery menus were randomly selected among the eight lottery menus and paired with six levels of payoff probabilities (probability of high-payoff: 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90%). These 24 unique pairs of gambles (one safer and one riskier gamble) were used in each trial type (Solo; Info: \u2018safe\u2019; Info: \u2018risky\u2019; and Info: \u2018mix\u2019), so in total, each participant had 96 trials (4 lottery menus \u00d7 6 probabilities \u00d7 4 trial types). The trial order was randomized for menu \u00d7 probability \u00d7 trial type with a unique order per participant. Participants were informed that their final payment was not dependent on any other players\u2019 choices and would be paid at the end of the task based on their choices. At the end of the task, one of the participants\u2019 choices was randomly selected and carried out to determine their final payment. We note that we have previously shown that the present task captures a social influence process (as opposed to a more general visual information effect or non-social influence). Specifically, in our previously published work [8], we introduced the task used here and also enrolled a separate cohort of N = 30 participants in a non-social condition designed to evaluate the \u2018social\u2019 nature of the social influence effect. In the non-social control task, participants were instructed that the two other \u2018players\u2019 were computers choosing between the gamble options, and the players were labeled as such on the display; all other task aspects were identical to the social version. In this non-social control, no effect of the computer chosen options on participants\u2019 choices were observed (see S8, reprinted with permission from [8], for further information). All statistical tests, except where indicated otherwise, were analyzed using a non-parametric bootstrapping method [61]. For each test, the data from all groups were drawn with replacement and assigned to groups that each had equal size as the original groups. For 10,000 iterations, the statistical test of interest was then performed on this \u2018resampled\u2019 data to obtain the null distribution. Specifically, for comparison between groups (t-tests and F-tests), a null test statistic distribution was obtained by randomly selecting data points from a set of pooled data points from all participants in each group being compared. For within-group analysis (correlation and regression tests), data were \u2018unpaired\u2019 by independently drawing the dependent and independent variables for each subject from the set of group values for that given variable. For the categorical demographics data, a chi-squared bootstrapped test was used; this test has been shown to be more accurate than the chi-square test on its own and has been suggested to be better than Fisher\u2019s exact test which has been criticized for being overly conservative [62]. For all tests, once the null distribution of the test statistic was obtained, significance could be assessed by comparison with the actual test statistic. Specifically, test statistics whose absolute value was greater than 9,500 of the absolute value of the null samples were considered significant (the equivalent of a two-tailed test with alpha level of 0.05). P values were calculated by getting the total percentage of null samples (absolute value) whose test statistics were greater than the absolute value of the test statistic of the actual data set. All statistical analysis was done using MATLAB R2015a (Mathworks) and R 3.3.0 [63]. To test our main hypotheses, we combined the dACC and insula lesion groups. When significant differences were observed, to assess robustness of differences to individual risk preferences, we performed the same statistical test again but on the residuals of the variable of interest after regressing out individuals\u2019 risk preference. Additionally, we proceeded with post-hoc analyses comparing dACC and insula lesion groups separately to explore the possibility of lesion-specific differences. When non-significant results were observed, we followed up with Bayesian null hypothesis testing (using the bayesFactor package in MATLAB) to quantify the extent of evidence (BFnull) that the groups being compared were similar (for t-tests) or that the variables being compared were unrelated (for correlation tests). The full model used in this paper is labeled as the Hybrid model. This model is a mixture of two different models: OCU-based and OCU-free models. Below, we first define these models separately, then specify the full model. Note that because the full model is a mixture model, the OCU-based and OCU-free models are both nested within this full model. We additionally use the following nested models in a formal model comparison: (i) Solo risk preference, (ii) OCU-based, and (iii) OCU-free (S4 Fig). \n\n\nwhere Phigh is the probability of high-payoff, V is the value of the high- and low- payoffs (as indicated) in the safe and risky gambles, and \u03b1 is risk preference where \u03b1 = 1 indicates risk neutrality, \u03b1 > 1 indicates risk seeking, and 0 < \u03b1 < 1 indicates risk aversion. \u03b2 is the sensitivity to utility differences between the safe and risky gambles (inverse temperature) where high value indicates less noisy behavior. The model includes four free parameters (two hyperparameters [mean, variance] \u00d7 two parameters): \u03b2 and \u03b1. \nwhere OCU is an additional utility added to the gamble chosen by others, and \u03b4 is an indicator where \u03b4 = 1 for Info: \u2018safe\u2019 trials, \u03b4 = \u20131 for Info: \u2018risky\u2019 trials, and \u03b4 = 0 otherwise. The model includes six free parameters (two hyperparameters [mean, variance] \u00d7 three parameters): \u03b2, \u03b1, and OCU. \u03c9follow: This \u2018follow others\u2019 choices\u2019 weight captures participants\u2019 tendency to select the same option as chosen by others (the safe or risky gamble), independent of utility computations. \u03c9oppose: This \u2018oppose others\u2019 choices\u2019 weight captures participants\u2019 tendency to choose the different option from the choice of others independent of utility computations. Note that Pfollow and Poppose are defined as probabilities of choosing the safe gamble, following and opposing others\u2019 choices, respectively. Two normalizing weights\u2014\u03c9follow and \u03c9oppose\u2014determine a relative relationship. Note that \u03c9follow + \u03c9oppose = 1 in this model and that each Info: \u2018safe\u2019 and Info: \u2018risky\u2019 trial choice is assumed to arise from a combination of the mixture weights. The model includes five free parameters (two hyperparameters [mean, variance] \u00d7 two parameters + two weights minus one): \u03b2, \u03b1, and one \u03c9. Note that although there are two weights in this model, only one is considered a free parameter; the second can only take on only one value since they must add to unity. Note that POCU on Solo and Info: \u2018mix\u2019 trials is equivalent to one\u2019s probability of choosing the safe gamble based on utility differences between the safe and risky gambles (P(safe) = POCU = [1 + exp(\u2212\u03b2 (Usafe\u2212 Urisky))]\u22121). The Hybrid model includes eight free parameters (two hyperparameters [mean, variance] \u00d7 three parameters + three weights minus one): inverse temperature \u03b2, risk preference \u03b1, OCU, and two \u03c9s. We extended this model to include the possibility that social information is used in the decision-making process independently of utility computation. This mixture model (\u2018Hybrid\u2019 model) consists of three probability weights, including: (i) probability of choosing the same gamble as others independent of the gamble information, (ii) probability of choosing the different option from others independent of the option information, and (iii) probability of choosing the safe option determined based on the expected utility [24] difference between the two options after taking into account the additional utility added to the option chosen by others (OCU). Three normalizing weights\u2014\u03c9follow, \u03c9oppose, and \u03c9utility\u2014determine a relative relationship. Note that \u03c9follow + \u03c9oppose + \u03c9utility = 1 and that each choice on Info: \u2018safe\u2019 and Info: \u2018risky\u2019 trials is represented as a mixture. The OCU weight (\u03c9utility) specifies how much one uses social information following the OCU-based computation, while the \u2018follow others\u2019 choices\u2019 weight (\u03c9follow) specifies the extent to which one uses the OCU-free heuristic (Fig 2). Alternative models for risk and social influence are discussed in S1 Text. For each model, unless otherwise specified, all 96 trials per participant were used for parameter estimations. Each model was constructed in a hierarchical structure where individuals were assumed to be sampled from a common group level distribution [64], aside from the weight parameters. For all hierarchical parameters, the group level distributions were defined as Gaussian with free group-level mean (\u03bc), SD (\u03c3), and a standard normal distribution (Normal(0, 1)) following non-centered parameterization [65]. We specified one group level distribution for each parameter across the lesion and control groups. For inverse temperature, an additional \u2018group difference\u2019 parameter was estimated separately for both the insula and dACC lesion groups, as these groups differed from NCs in their inverse temperature estimates in preliminary analyses examining Solo trials using the solo risk preference model. For inverse temperature \u03b2 and risk preference \u03b1, we applied an exponential transformation. We estimated the hyperparameters (i.e., group-level priors) for \u03b2, \u03b1, and OCU using weak priors: \u03bc ~ Normal(0, 10) and \u03c3 ~ half-Cauchy(0, 2.5). Sets of \u03c9 were defined as simplex, so that the sum of weights was always 1. We applied a group-level uniform distribution to \u03c9s, thus the weights were only estimated at an individual-level. For all parameter estimations, we used Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) [66] variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo implemented in Stan [67] in its R interface [65]. A total of four chains were run where each drew 5000 samples, discarding the first 2000 samples for burn-in (giving a total of 12,000 post-burn-in draws). All values of the potential scale reduction factor () were below 1.1 and we visually inspected the chains for parameter convergence and good mixing [68]. As specified above, the Hybrid model is the most general model. That is, other models can be represented as a special case of the general model (nested models). When comparing model fits between participant groups, we calculated the median negative log likelihood (\u2013LL). To formally compare fits between models including penalties for model complexity, we computed an integrated Bayesian Information Criteria (iBIC) [69] per model. Note that iBIC evaluates model fit not just at point estimates, but across the whole posterior distribution [69]. Because individuals\u2019 estimated parameters using hierarchical Bayesian estimation are dependent on the group posterior, to allow for group differences to be identified (if they are present), we estimated two additional group-level mean difference parameters for both the inverse temperature and risk preference parameters; statistical tests were conducted by examining whether or not the 95% credible interval (CI) for each group-level parameter crosses zero. Because we found inverse temperature, but not risk preference, differences between groups in the Solo trials, all models presented here (unless otherwise specified) were estimated using an inverse temperature mean difference parameter for each lesion group. Bootstrapped t-tests were used to compare weights among groups. Note that the weights are not dependent on the group distribution (because they were not part of a hierarchical structure), and thus, classical t-tests can be used to examine individual differences (Fig 3A\u20133C). To examine the correlation between model fit (\u2212LL) and \u03c9follow, \u2212LL was estimated from the Solo risk preference model using only Solo trials and \u03c9follow was estimated from the Hybrid model (Fig 3D). To confirm that the task design is sensitive enough to capture individual differences within the model structure, we sampled 44 sets (the same as our sample size) of parameters (\u03b1 and OCU for 44 simulated subjects; \u2018true parameters\u2019 hereafter) using the mean and standard deviation for the estimated group-level distributions (estimated from individuals\u2019 raw choice data). Actual \u03b2 parameters were used from each subject. For the three weights (\u03c9follow, \u03c9oppose, and \u03c9utility), we sampled the weights uniformly from a unit simplex, satisfying \u03c9follow + \u03c9oppose + \u03c9utility = 1 and restricting values between minimum and maximum values of subject \u03c9s. Using the same gamble sequences that were presented to participants, we simulated individual choice data, and examined whether the true parameters were recovered or not. Because simulated choices are subject to some randomness, some simulated choice sets generated sequences that did not meet inclusion criteria for the study. As specified earlier (in Participants), this can lead to estimation issues. Thus, simulated behaviors went through the same exclusionary criteria as actual participants\u2019 behavior (see Participants for exclusion criteria). If a simulated participant\u2019s behavior was excluded, a new set of parameters was generated and used to re-simulate behavioral choices. The same parameter estimation procedure was used as described above. All estimated parameters were significantly correlated with the true parameters used to generate simulated data (inverse temperature (log transform): Pearson\u2019s r = 0.81, P = 1.86e\u221211; risk preference: Pearson\u2019s r = 0.86, P = 7.32e\u221214; OCUnormalized: Pearson\u2019s r = 0.76, P = 2.75e\u221209; \u03c9follow: Pearson\u2019s r = 0.88, P = 4.38e\u221215; \u03c9oppose: Pearson\u2019s r = 0.90, P = 1.46e\u221216; \u03c9utility: Pearson\u2019s r = 0.73, P = 2.44e\u221208). Note that the OCU parameter was normalized to show the actual contribution of OCU to the utility function, as follows:\n Stan makes it possible to efficiently estimate models with multiple hierarchical levels and many parameters. It does so by using a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm to move quickly through the posterior distribution with minimal correlation between parameters. To efficiently sample from the posterior distribution, it simulates a Hamiltonian \u2018trajectory.\u2019 Comparing the initial and final Hamiltonian values in a given iteration provides a straightforward way to detect potential sampling errors. Specifically, these are detected when Stan\u2019s approximation of a Hamiltonian trajectory deviates significantly from the true Hamiltonian trajectory, called a \u2018divergent transition.\u2019 In practice, when these \u2018divergent transitions\u2019 occur, it can bias the posterior distribution. To be clear, none of the models estimated on participant data had any divergent transitions. However, in model recovery for the Hybrid model, approximately 1.05% of iterations had divergent transitions. Because we know the actual estimates that the simulated data was generated from, we can directly test if the divergent transitions biased the recovery results. To determine this, we compare the estimates to the true parameters. By definition, if the divergent transitions bias the posterior, it would push the estimates away from the true parameters. As we see strong correlations between the true parameters and parameter estimates from simulated data, we conclude that the divergent transitions did not bias the posterior estimates and that the model is sensitive enough to capture individual differences within the model structure. Similar model estimation issues and logic apply to the model recovery (S4) and exclusion criteria analyses (S7). In addition to parameter recovery, we performed model recovery to assess whether the four models used and tested in this paper are dissociable [70]. To do so, we simulated participant choices using each of the four models: Hybrid, Solo risk preference, OCU-based, and OCU-free. We simulated choice data according to each model for 44 subjects (referred to as \u2018Simulated model\u2019 hereafter). These data were created based on parameters drawn from the actual distribution of estimated parameters for each model, restricted to be within the range of parameter estimates. Actual \u03b2 parameters were used for each model (in the same way as Parameter recovery). The data generated from each Simulated model was then used to fit all four models. We then calculated how well each of these models (Fit model) fit the data using iBIC. The fits are calculated at the group level as total iBIC (S4a) and at an individual level using participant counts of best fit for each model, calculated as a proportion summing to 100% for each Simulated model to calculate a confusion matrix (S4b) or calculated as a proportion summing to 100% for each Fit model to calculate the inversion matrix (S4c). We note that these analyses indicate that these models are not well-dissociable. Thus, while our main results are based on robust parameter estimates of the Hybrid model, it is important to keep in mind that the Hybrid model alone is unlikely to fully and uniquely capture the range of social influences on risky decision-making. See S4 for further discussion of this point. (a) We used multiple linear regression to examine whether the lesion group was indeed impaired in risky decision-making. Specifically, we set group identity (NC vs lesion), probability of winning the high payoff, and their interaction as predictors of individuals\u2019 gamble choices (proportion of safe choices, P(safe)) on Solo trials. As expected, on average, across all groups, individuals chose the safe option significantly less as the probability of winning the high payoff increased (P = 9.2e\u22124). In addition, the interaction effect was significant (group (NC vs lesion) \u00d7 probability interaction: P = 0.022). Specifically, the extent to which individuals chose the safe option less as a function of the gamble\u2019 probability was attenuated in the lesion group compared to NCs. In line with previous reports [20,21], these results suggest that individuals with insula and dACC lesions are impaired in risky decision-making. (b) Lesion participants and NC response times in Solo trials were compared. Individuals with insula or dACC lesions took significantly longer to make a choice compared to NCs (P = 0.026; NC vs insula: P = 0.045; NC vs dACC: P = 0.066), which provides an additional measure indicating disrupted decision-making about risky options. Each point represents an individual participant; Error bars represent s.e.m. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1012602.s001 (PDF) (a) To confirm that we can identify each parameter independently from other parameters within the Hybrid model, we conducted a parameter recovery analysis. To do so, we simulated artificial data and estimated the model on that data to see if the \u2018true parameters\u2019 used to simulate data could be identified. Correlations between true parameters and estimates indicate parameter recovery for that specific parameter (see Materials and Methods for parameter recovery procedure). All parameters included in the model showed positive correlation between the true and estimated parameters, indicating that the Hybrid model could be recovered: inverse temperature (log transform; Pearson\u2019s r = 0.81, P = 1.86e\u201311), risk preference (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.86, P = 7.32e\u201314), OCUnormalized (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.76, P = 2.75e\u201309), \u03c9follow (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.88, P = 4.38e\u201315), \u03c9oppose (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.90, P = 1.46e\u201316), and \u03c9utility (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.73, P = 2.44e\u201308). (b-d) To confirm that the \u03c9follow and \u03c9oppose parameters are capturing an individual\u2019s behavior, we compared these parameters to a model-agnostic measure of an individual\u2019s tendency to conform to or oppose the choices of others. In healthy adults, we previously showed individuals who were more risk averse (or seeking) were more likely to conform when others chose the safe (or risky) choices but less likely to conform when others chose the risky (safe) choices. Moreover, in these individuals utilizing the OCU-based model, the tendency to conform to others\u2019 safe choices was negatively correlated with the tendency to conform to others\u2019 risky choices. Individuals following this pattern will fall close to the y = 1 \u2212 x line in b. Conversely, individuals who tend to use the OCU-free weights to a greater extent in the decision-making process will fall further away from this line, since they are more likely to follow or oppose others regardless of the type of information. Thus, to validate our model, we test if the orthogonal distance from the y = 1 \u2212 x line (the solid lines in b are shown as examples) correlates with the extent to which individuals use the OCU-free weights. As expected, there is a significant correlation between this model-agnostic measure of conformity tendency and both \u03c9follow (c; r = 0.72, P = 4.07e\u221208, robust correlation) and \u03c9oppose (d, r = \u22120.77, P = 1.33e\u221209, robust correlation) across all individuals, which shows that the model parameters accurately capture individuals\u2019 behavioral choices. Each point represents an individual participant, and lines are the regressions between the indicated parameters. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1012602.s002 (PDF) (a-c) Each individual\u2019s behavioral choices on Info: \u2018safe\u2019 (blue) and Info: \u2018risky\u2019 (red) trials were overlaid with their predicted choices (solid lines) based on the Hybrid model. For each participant, P(safe) is binned and averaged based on the expected value difference between the safe and risky gambles. (d-f) Estimates of normalizing weights between decision computations are shown for each group. While there existed individual variation across groups, a majority of those with dACC or insula lesions showed greater \u03c9follow weights than OCU weights (\u03c9utility). Estimates shown are from the Hybrid model (see Materials and Methods for parameter estimation details). https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1012602.s003 (PDF) To evaluate whether our models are dissociable from one another [70], we performed model recovery analyses. Specifically, we simulated choice data from each model (Simulated model; Hybrid, Solo risk preference, OCU-based, OCU-free) and tested which model best fit the simulated data (Fit model). (a) At the group level, the best fit for each simulated model was the true model used to generate the data. (b) At the individual level, we examined the best fitting model for each simulated participant. As expected, the model used to generate the data had the highest proportion of simulated participants as its best fit. (c) We also calculated the inversion matrix (i.e., the proportion of the time that the best fitting model was generated by the simulated model). For all four models, the best fitting model matches the simulated data the largest proportion of the time. However, note that these models are not well-dissociable (i.e., the confusion and inversion matrices differ from the identity matrix). This could be due to several reasons, including the nested nature of the models, a relatively small contribution of the OCU parameter to behavior (as compared to the heuristic weights or risk preference), and\/or the presence of multiple overlapping processes during socially-situated decision making about risky options, among other factors. While our main results are based on robust parameter estimates of the Hybrid model (and not model fit), it is important to keep in mind that the Hybrid model alone is unlikely to fully and uniquely capture the range of social influences on risky decision-making. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1012602.s004 (PDF) (a) The model fit of the Hybrid model was compared with other nested models. The Hybrid model (see Materials and Methods for model structure) explained participants\u2019 behavioral choices the best (smaller integrated Bayesian information criteria (iBIC) indicates better fit). Note that we performed a parameter recovery analysis (S2) and showed that we could separately identify each parameter. (b) In an independent sample of healthy controls (N = 57, [8]), we show the same relationship (as in Fig 2d) between non-social model fit (\u2013LL) and individuals\u2019 social conformity heuristic (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.51, P = 5.78e\u201305, robust correlation) as was found in the subjects in the current study. Weight parameters for social conformity heuristic were estimated using the Hybrid model, while model fit was calculated from the Solo risk preference model only using Solo trials. Models for healthy controls were estimated in a similar fashion as the original study participants, with the exception that inverse temperature was constrained between 0 and 50, and risk preference was constrained between 0 and 2. Each point represents an individual participant, and lines are the regressions between the indicated parameters; Error bars represent s.e.m. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1012602.s005 (PDF) To examine whether the effects of social influence from the past trials persist, we compared Solo trial choices with and without Info trials either on one or two trials back. Specifically, we estimated two mixed-effects logistic regression models (using subject as the random effect) separately for NCs and the lesion group to predict safe choices on Solo trials with a regressor corresponding to previous social influence (Info: \u2018safe\u2019 trials were coded as 1, Info: \u2018risky\u2019 trials were coded as \u22121). These analyses showed that there was no effect of previous social influence (neither one- nor two- back) on the choices made on subsequent Solo trials in either NCs or the lesion group (all Ps > 0.05). The fixed effect beta coefficients and their standard errors are depicted for the one- and two- back conditions, and for each group separately. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1012602.s006 (PDF) In the main text, we use two main exclusion criteria: 1) participants who chose the option with the greater high payoff value less frequently as the probability of winning increased, suggesting a misunderstanding or lack of attention to the task, and 2) participants who always chose either the safe or the risky option in the Solo trials, and thus for whom bi-directional influence is not possible. To check the robustness of our main findings with respect to exclusions, we conducted the main analyses without exclusions; these analyses indicate that our main results remain largely consistent even when individuals excluded from our analyses in the main text are reinserted. (a-c) When all participants were included (control N = 46, insula N = 11, and dACC N = 11), we observed a trending result of the worse model fit (P = 0.12) and the increased follow weight (P = 0.11) for lesion participants. In addition, the correlation between worse model fit and the follow weight was significant (r = 0.45, P = 1.2e\u221204). (d-f) When participants who did not show reasonable choices in trivial cases remained excluded, but the ones who always chose either the safe or risky option were reincluded (control N = 25, insula N = 10, and dACC N = 8), we observed a trending result of the worse model fit (P = 0.092) and the increased follow weight (P = 0.027) for lesion participants. Furthermore, the correlation between worse model fit and the follow weight was significant (r = 0.46, P = 4.9e\u221204). Overall, although some of the results are statistically marginal, these data show that the main results remain consistent even when we are more lenient with our exclusion criteria. https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pcbi.1012602.s007 (PDF) As a control analysis for the 2015 study introducing this task [8], we performed a \u2018computer control\u2019 on 30 healthy participants. Specifically, to assess whether the observed influence of others was a social or more general information effect (e.g., priming with visual information), we implemented a separate behavioral experiment instructing participants that \u2018Info\u2019 trials were computer-generated choices. The visual aspects and trial structure of the original game were maintained, and as in the original task, participants chose between two gambles. Participants were instructed that on some trials (previously the \u2018Info\u2019 trials), prior to the participant\u2019s decision, two computers would randomly pick among the options, and these two options would be presented (\u2018Computer Info\u2019 trials). As in the original experiment, \u2018Solo\u2019 trials were interspersed with the Computer Info trials. No influence of computer-selected options on participants\u2019 choices was observed (repeated measures ANOVA, F(3, 87) = 0.71, P = 0.55; paired t-tests: Safe vs Solo, t(29) = 0.61, P = 0.55; Mix vs Solo, t(29) = 0.90, P = 0.37; Risky vs Solo, t(29) = -0.52, P = 0.37).

Officials did a lot of handwringing about the issue during a roundtable at the recently completed COP29 environmental conclave. But in highlighting urgent needs, participants didn\u2019t proffer many ideas about how to mitigate the myriad challenges.\u00a0 Globally, about 40 percent of agricultural land is vulnerable to degradation, Azerbaijan\u2019s agriculture minister, Majnun Mammadov, stated in his opening remarks at the roundtable, adding as much as 12 million acres of arable land around the world becomes unproductive every year.\u00a0\n\n\n Conditions are particularly acute in Tajikistan, where almost one-third of the country\u2019s agricultural land is in \u201ccritical condition,\u201d according to a report published by the Asia-Plus news agency. But such challenges as deforestation, soil salinization and over-grazing are threatening other Central Asian states too, especially Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Citing UN data, the Asia-Plus report stated that 39 percent of Central Asia\u2019s landmass is experiencing drought. In presenting a plan to introduce water-conserving and soil-monitoring technologies in Uzbekistan, the country\u2019s ecology minister, Aziz Abdukhakimov, exuded a sense of urgency. \u201cWe must act quickly and decisively, otherwise we will leave only deserts for future generations,\u201d he stated. Participants agreed that a multilateral approach was needed to address soil degradation, but no specific initiatives to promote joint action were discussed. Even if plans had been worked out to address problems, Central Asian states lack the funds to fully implement them on their own. And that situation doesn\u2019t look like it will change anytime soon. Developing nations say substantive climate action will take over $1 trillion per year in funding from wealthy nations. Yet, after prolonged and, at times, bitter negotiations at COP29 in Baku, wealthy nations agreed to commit $300 billion annually to address global-warming related issues, including soil degradation.\u00a0 That figure marks a substantial increase over the $100 billion that wealthy nations had previously pledged to commit to help developing countries adapt to global warming conditions. But somehow everyone departed Baku full of hard feelings. Developing nations accused the globally rich of being cheap. At the same time, many wealthy nations, especially the United States and European Union members, were angry that economically advanced states, such as China and Saudi Arabia, claimed to still be developing countries not obligated to make any contribution to the COP climate action fund. The causes of soil degradation are not new, with many linked to global warming. A report published by the UN Convention to Combat Desertification in 2022 also identified several man-made factors contributing to the loss of farmland and pasture across Central Asia, including an overreliance on cotton cultivation and inefficient irrigation practices.\n\n\n The cumulative effects of soil degradation are heightening social challenges across the region, acting as a \u201csignificant trigger\u201d for migration from the countryside to cities, resulting in increases in air pollution, according to the UN report. It also cautioned that a vicious cycle of social harm, fueling a decline in living standards in Central Asia, is taking hold. \u201cLand degradation, combined with increasing anthropogenic pressure caused by population growth and density, leads to a decrease in the availability of productive land and water resources, a drop in crop yields and livestock productivity,\u201d UN study states.

But will he get in the way?","description":"S&P 500 is tipped to gain 7% next year, but will it?","url":"https:\/\/www.irishtimes.com\/business\/2024\/12\/07\/trumps-favourite-index-is-tipped-to-rally-further-in-2025-but-will-he-get-in-the-way\/","published_at":"2024-12-07T06:00:00Z","content":"Donald Trump\u2019s vetting of cabinet picks second time round may have thrown up some blunders, with his nominee to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) this week following the fate of Matt Gaetz\u2019s short-lived candidacy for attorney general. Chad Chronister, currently a Florida sheriff, withdrew his name to run the DEA from consideration \u2013 though Trump says he pulled the plug \u2013 on Wednesday as a result of uproar among Republicans over his arrest of a pastor in 2020 for holding large services during a Covid lockdown. It follows Gaetz withdrawing his name for lawyer-in-chief last month amid allegations of sexual misconduct. However, the band Trump is putting together elsewhere \u2013 including hedge fund billionaire Scott Bessent being picked as treasury secretary, oil industry veteran Chris Wright as energy secretary, stockbroking firm Cantor Fitzgerald chief executive Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary, and Paul Atkins, a free marketeer and crypto-friendly lawyer, as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2013 has been warmly received at a constituency close to his heart: Wall Street. The stock market, as we learned during Trump\u2019s first term in office, is Trump\u2019s favoured barometer of success \u2013 having regularly peppered speeches back then with the question, \u201cHow\u2019s your 401(K) doing?\u201d That referred to the stock-laden retirement savings vehicles used by more than 100 million Americans. New York\u2019s S&P 500 index of blue-chip US companies, the world\u2019s most widely followed equities index, has advanced almost 5.5 per cent since Trump outflanked Kamala Harris just over a month ago \u2013 bringing its advance so far this year to 28 per cent, and to an all-time high. Investors have committed almost $140 billion (\u20ac132.3 billion) of fresh money to US equity funds since the election, with November being the busiest month for inflows on records stretching back to 2000, on hopes the incoming administration will unleash sweeping tax cuts and reforms to help corporate America, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing figures from market data provider EPFR. The S&P 500, which has a major influence on stock markets globally, is on track to reach 6,500 points by the end of next year, according to median forecast of 48 equity strategists recently polled by Reuters. That points to about a 7 per cent advance from current levels. Former Iseq heavyweights CRH and Flutter Entertainment have quit the Irish market in the past 15 months and moved their main listings to the US with an aim of ultimately joining the S&P 500. Smurfit Kappa secured direct entry to the index in July when it merged with a US cardboard box-making rival to form Smurfit Westrock. But never has the US market been dominated by so few. The so-called magnificent seven group of high-performing stocks \u2013 including Nvidia, the maker of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) computer chips, Microsoft, Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Apple and Amazon \u2013 have driven the broader market higher in 2024. Nvidia\u2019s 200 per cent surge alone has fuelled a fifth of the S&P 500\u2019s gain this year. And the seven are seen leading the way again in 2025, according to strategists. There\u2019s a lot of hope priced into equities right now. But investors don\u2019t have to look too far to see red flags. Following this year\u2019s rally, companies on the S&P 500 are trading at an average of 23 times expected earnings, according to stock market research firm Birinyi Associates. That\u2019s well over the 10-year average of about 18. Tech valuations are even more stretched. Joe Davis, chief economist of Vanguard, the world\u2019s second-largest manager, warned this week that the market had overestimated the short-term potential of AI technology, increasing the risk of a price \u201ccorrection\u201d. He said some tech valuations were approaching those of 1997 \u2013 referring to the tech bubble era. While JP Morgan strategists were upbeat on equities in their 2025 market outlook, published this week, as central banks continue to ease interest rates and the new US administration embarks on a programme of deregulation, they warned of a risk of \u201cdisruptive Trump policies triggering a crash landing\u201d. Historically high prices for US housing, crypto currencies (Bitcoin breached $100,000 for the first time on Thursday) and gold, as well as low corporate bond market interest rates, relative to risk, broaden the potential fallout. The Central Bank of Ireland highlighted in a report this week that there is a \u201cwidening disconnect\u201d between economic uncertainty \u2013 also stemming from the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East, and fears about a possible US-China clash over Taiwan \u2013 and current low volatility in global equity and debt markets. This increases the chances of a \u201csharp repricing of assets\u201d, it warned. Trump 2.0, with a return of \u201cAmerica first\u201d, has already seen the president-elect suggest universal tariffs on all goods imported to the US and sharply higher levies on Chinese goods. He has also threatened neighbouring Mexico and Canada with 25 per cent taxes on goods from both unless they stem immigration to the US and flows of drugs. Economists have said tariffs will be inflationary and force the US Federal Reserve to reverse course on its current cycle of easing interest rates. \u201cThe effects would be inflationary in the short term \u2013 with companies facing higher input costs and consumers paying more for finished goods; [and be] a drag on US GDP in the medium term, while underpinning still-high benchmark interest rates,\u201d said S&P Global Ratings. GDP stands for gross domestic product. Inflation could also be stoked if mass deportations of illegal immigrants kick in \u2013 or people start self-deporting in droves \u2013 under Trump. Fewer workers in some industries could put upward pressure on wages. Stock market bulls argue Trump will be quick to change course on any economically disruptive policies if they lead to a stock market sell-off. But that won\u2019t prevent volatility in the meantime. And incoming cabinet members should know from the experience of the walking wounded from Trump\u2019s first administration, he\u2019ll always find someone else to blame.

During the investment conference held in London by the Athens stock exchange and Morgan Stanley, Greek companies will mainly refer to acquisitions that they have already planned this year, but also to their expansion in new markets During the investment conference held in London by the Athens stock exchange and Morgan Stanley, Greek companies will mainly refer to acquisitions that they have already planned this year, but also to their expansion in new markets. They will focus on the disclosure of their investment programs, which will include the construction of new factories and the creation of new products. At the same time, foreign funds will be asked how they will deal with the imposition of tariffs by the Trump administration, while foreigners will want to know how they will respond to the raw materials market. Foreign funds are expected to show particular interest in companies in the energy sector, especially in the country\u2019s transition to a lower-emissions mix. Also, leading international funds will request information on the course of reforms (especially in the judicial system), but also on the progress of investments within the framework of the Recovery Fund. 90% of the capitalization of the Stock Exchange, which currently represents a market value of 85 billion euros, is represented by the presidents and CEOs of the 38 listed companies who have been in London. The listed companies participating are: IPTO, Aegean Airlines, Alpha Bank, Athens stock exchange, Athens International Airport, EYDAP, AustriaCard, Autohellas, Avax, Bank of Cyprus, Cenergy Holdings, Coca Cola HBC, Ellaktor, Eurobank, Fourlis, GEK Terna, Terna Energy, OPAP, OTE, Helleniq Energy, Intrakat, Intralot, Kri Kri, Lamda Development, Metlen, Motor Oil, National Bank, Optima bank, Piraeus Bank, PPA, Profile, PPC, Sarantis, Titan, Trade Estates, Viohalco, ElvalHalcor and Noval Properties. The biggest names in institutional companies worldwide have declared their participation in this year\u2019s event. These are BlackRock, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Fidelity Management & Research, Goldman Sachs, GSO, Hamblin Watsa Investments Council, Invesco, JP Morgan, One Investments, Schroders, Soros Fund Management, Stewart Investors, Trowe Price, TT International and Wellington. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis is expected to open the conference on Monday. He will participate in a meeting with institutional investors and talk with the vice-chairman of Morgan Stanley\u2019s Investment Banking, Luigi Rizzo. Energy issues will also be raised. A fireside chat with Evangelos Mytilineos and Michael O\u2019Dwyer, Managing Director for Oil & Gas Investment Banking at MS, will follow. Also scheduled for today is, among other things, a panel with companies that were recently listed on the Athens Stock Exchange, such as Athens International Airport, Optima and Bank of Cyprus. The first day closes with the discussion of the Prime Minister\u2019s economic advisor, Alexis Patelis, with Mike Wilson (Chief Strategist for US Equities and Chief Investment Officer at MS) and Ellen Zentner (Chief Economic Strategy and Head of Thematic and Macroeconomic Investments at Morgan Stanley Wealth). The appointments of listed companies with fund managers and analysts are numerous, between 750-800, while several have also been booked on the sidelines of the conference that will be held at Morgan Stanley\u2019s facilities overlooking Cabot Square and the London docks. This year\u2019s roadshows will conclude on Thursday, December 5, in Geneva, where the Athens stock exchange is organizing an event with the participation of listed companies of the mid-cap. On Monday, December 9, Capital Link is organizing a conference in New York where John Paulson, a close associate of newly elected US President Donald Trump, will be present and speak."},{"source":"Slashdot.org","author":"feedfeeder","title":"Singapore cenbank fines JPMorgan $1.8 mln over misconduct by relationship managers - Reuters","description":"Singapore cenbank fines JPMorgan $1.8 mln over misconduct by relationship managersReuters Singapore Fines JPMorgan for Misconduct Over Client Bond TradesBloomberg Singapore cenbank fines JPMorgan $1.8 million over misconduct by relationship managersYahoo Fina\u2026","url":"https:\/\/slashdot.org\/firehose.pl?op=view&amp;id=175577627","published_at":"2024-12-02T08:52:38Z","content":"Want to read Slashdot from your mobile device?

Shares plunged 9.60% on the NSE to \u20b9537.90  --Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart Ltd The rupee is at a record low of 84.73 versus the dollar. Since a weaker rupee raises the cost of imports and may result in higher inflation rates, the recent drop of the Indian rupee vs the US dollar has important ramifications for the Indian economy. Customers may be harmed and their purchasing power diminished. The growing expense of servicing foreign currency debt represents a hardship for companies that have such debt. Indian businesses may find it more costly to obtain money overseas if their currency depreciates since it can undermine investor confidence. The timing of a rupee reversal is unpredictable and contingent on a number of variables like rupee might gain from a downturn in the US economy or a weakening of the US currency. The rupee can be stabilized with the support of stronger economic development and better export results. The rupee can be supported by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervening in the foreign exchange market, although this is a temporary solution. It\u2019s crucial to remember that the economy doesn\u2019t always suffer when the rupee declines. It might be a normal response to shifting international economic circumstances. On the other hand, economic instability may result from excessive depreciation. The secret is to balance the risks and rewards of managing the exchange rate.

India is the second largest cement producer globally, after China and produces nearly 10% of the global production. Cement production contributes to 7-8% of CO2 emissions globally and over 6% of emissions in India. The industry has traditionally had a huge dependence on fossil fuels and this is why the RotoDynamic Heater (RDH), a patented technology of Coolbrook, which is supposed to be the only electric tech solution to achieve temperatures up to 1700C is very welcome. As per Coolbrook, the RDH can replace fossil fired furnaces and kilns and effectively decarbonise the industrial heating process. The Company believes adoption of its technology could help reduce CO2 emissions from cement manufacturing, globally, by 30%. Ambuja is planning to run its production process entirely on electricity generated from renewable sources and given Ambuja\u2019s position as one of the top cement producers globally, this development will have a significant impact on emissions and India\u2019s Net Zero goals by 2070. Cement industry is already working on decarbonising with firms such as Shree Cement planning to use only renewable energy by 2050, JK Cement and Ultratech cement planning to reduce emissions by 21% and 34% respectively.

Read more Can Fin Homes Ltd Dividend Per Share Rs. 6 Previous day Closing Price \u2013 Rs. 815 Ex-Dividend 04 Dec 2024 (Tomorrow) Last date for Cum-Dividend Today US stocks ended mostly higher on Monday, with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite scoring record closing highs on Monday, boosted by tech-related shares following the market\u2019s strong November gains, as investors awaited this week\u2019s economic data including the key monthly jobs report on Friday. Investors also digested comments from Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller that he was inclined to cut the benchmark interest rate at the Dec. 17-18 meeting as monetary policy remained restrictive. In the U.S., data showed manufacturing contracted at a moderate pace in November, with orders growing for the first time in eight months and factories facing significantly lower prices for inputs. The ISM said its manufacturing PMI rose to a five-month high of 48.4 from 46.5 in October, which was the lowest level since July 2023. U.S. construction spending increased more than expected in October, boosted by single-family homebuilding. The Commerce Department\u2019s Census Bureau said on Monday construction spending rose 0.4% after an unrevised 0.1% gain in September. A Reuters survey of economists estimated payrolls increasing by 200,000 jobs in November after rising by 12,000 in October, the fewest since December 2020. Asian shares broadly rose to track Wall Street\u2019s tech-led gains, with China a laggard after the yuan fell to a one-year low against the dollar on concerns about a weak economy and heightened tensions with the US. Nifty extended gains to the second day on Dec 02. At close, Nifty was up 0.60% or 144.9 points at 24276.1. Nifty continued its upside momentum on Dec 02 and a reasonable bullish candle was formed on the daily chart with a lower shadow. A decisive move above the hurdle of 24350 will not only confirm the higher bottom reversal pattern at 23873 levels (28th Nov), but also signal important trend reversal in Nifty on the upside. The short-term trend of Nifty remains positive. A sharp upside breakout above 24350 in the next couple of sessions could open upside towards the next resistance zone of 24700-24900 levels. Immediate support is at 24100. \u201cThe RBI\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee faces a delicate balancing act. With GDP growth slowing more than expected and inflation showing mixed signals, their upcoming decision is likely to prioritize careful adjustments to address immediate challenges while maintaining a focus on long-term stability. Given the tight liquidity conditions, they may choose measures to ease liquidity and\/or cut rates which could serve as a strong signal to the market.\u201d Equity markets are expected to open on a flat-to-positive note amidst positive global cues. Stock markets closed strongly higher on Monday, despite weak GDP data. Analysts expect the positive momentum to continue at least till RBI\u2019s monetary policy outcome on Friday.

The proof-of-concept of what has been dubbed the Regulated Settlement Network (RSN) showcased the potential of shared ledger technology to upgrade multi-asset and cross-network transaction settlement for domestic users of US dollars and regulated securities. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n06 December 2024\n1 comment\n This content has been selected, created and edited by the Finextra editorial team based upon its relevance and interest to our community. Led by SIFMA - the\u00a0Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association - the working group included\u00a0Citi, JP Morgan, Mastercard, Swift, TD Bank, US Bank, USDF (a membership-based association of insured depository institutions,) Wells Fargo, Visa, and Zions Bancorp. Further, the core technology for the PoC was provided by Digital Asset, the network interlinking the prototype for the cross-network interoperability was provided by Swift, and legal services were provided by Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, while Deloitte & Touche LLP provided advisory services to SIFMA. Alongside this, contributors from BNY, Broadridge, DTCC,\u00a0The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), Tassat Group, the MITRE Corporation, and the New York Innovation Center (NYIC) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York were also involved in the project.\u00a0 After the\u00a0initial PoC in July 2023, the group went on to test\u00a0how simultaneous and coordinated 24\/7 settlement capabilities could be achieved for multi-asset and cross-network transactions involving tokenised central and commercial bank deposits, US Treasury securities, and other regulated assets. Interoperability is required as at the moment,\u00a0transfers of commercial bank deposits, wholesale central bank deposits, and US Treasuries and investment grade debt securities are settled on separate, siloed systems. This means that transaction processing is inefficient, operational risks are increased, costs are higher, transparency is reduced, and settlement times are slower. The most recent study into the RSN PoC explored how shared ledger technology can address these issues with tokenisation of regulated financial instruments so that settlement can occur 24\/7. In addition, this experiment was conducted in a test environment and leveraged simulated data to make transactions in USD. The PoC focused on designing a financial market infrastructure (FMI) that could potentially settle tokenised US Treasuries, IG bonds, central bank deposits, and commercial bank deposits according to pre-determined characteristics. As well as multi-asset delivery, after connecting the RSN FMI to multiple third-party networks, cross-network interoperability was tested to achieve synchronised settlement. The findings are summarised below: Kelly Mathieson, chief business development officer, Digital Asset, says: \"At the heart of its success was a meticulous design stage, which shaped the technology infrastructure to deliver seamless simultaneous settlement. Solving for configuration, functional challenges, API changes, test case development, and execution, provides a road map for other initiatives to consider and replicate.\u201d\u201cThe US RSN showcases how interconnected, synchronised applications can eliminate complexity and enhance operational efficiency, redefining standards for modern financial markets. It is not just a technological milestone, but a collaborative effort that sets the stage for a unified digital market infrastructure. To avoid narrow proof-of-concept silos, we\u2019ve prioritised broad integration and scalability from the outset. By implementing true simultaneous settlement and leveraging real-time updates, the US RSN exemplifies how next-generation networks could operate. This innovative approach offers an opportunity to minimise settlement delays and reduce operational risks.\" \u00a0 A Finextra member\u00a0 \n09 December 2024\n this is incomprehensible - can anyone explain what a RSN is, what it does and why it is needed? \n\/crypto\n \n06 December 2024\n \n\/wholesale\n \n04 December 2024\n \n\/payments\n \n18 November 2024\n \n\/crypto\n \n15 November 2024\n \n\/markets\n \n12 November 2024\n \n\/crypto\n \n04 November 2024\n \n\/crypto\n \n04 November 2024\n \n\/markets\n \n28 October 2024\n \n\/crypto\n \n16 October 2024\n Welcome to Finextra.

The central bank may want to monitor more economic indicators before deciding. The FY25 inflation is projected is hiked to 4.8%, which is a bit higher compared to the one projected in the last meeting. Nevertheless, it is still within the RBI tolerance band and is expected to start easing from Q4 of current FY25.\u00a0 The GDP growth projection for FY25 has been slashed to 6.6% from the earlier 7.2% indicating the effects of high food inflation. Going ahead, high food inflation in the domestic market and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and between Russia-Ukraine will continue to remain a huge concern which could further lead to a slowdown in trade activities of gems and jewelry. However, continuation of neutral stance by RBI to support growth is a much-needed step which indicates a low-rate regime in sight.\u201d Several prominent pharmaceutical companies like Poly Medicure Ltd, Unichem Laboratories Ltd, and Wockhardt Ltd were among the top losers, shedding 3.53 per cent, 2.86 per cent, and 2.79 per cent of their value, respectively.

The moderation in growth and the persistence of headline inflation are concerning factors that may necessitate timely policy support. Addressing the challenge of stimulating growth is critical and should not be overlooked. Core inflation has consistently remained below the 4% target for nearly a year. Looking ahead, food inflation is expected to ease due to lower commodity prices, a slowdown in demand as seen in GDP numbers, comfortable reservoir levels, seasonal drops in vegetable prices, and higher Kharif harvest. We anticipate a 25 basis points rate reduction in the upcoming February policy.\u201d The RBI has erred on caution. They did a CRR cut, but no Repo cut (our base case in pre-policy expected one of the two, with dispersion risks). No rate cuts mean no shocks. However, RBI announced CRR cut to ease liquidity. They did not have much choice. With liquidity set to tighten by around 1.5 lac cr, RBI had to give durable liquidity. In fact, RBI\u2019s FX swaps earlier this week had already forewarned us about this action. RBI has changed their view on inflation targeting. Inflation management has now become \u201cflexible\u201d, from a target of \u201c4%\u201d. Thus, the RBI continues to move in the direction cast in the last policy when they mentioned that they have a \u201cdual mandate\u201d of growth and inflation. Also, when inflation was close to 4%, RBI decided to \u201clook through it\u201d as CPI would rise in Q3 (which it did) and it was \u201cinflation projection\u201d that mattered, not \u201ccurrent inflation\u201d. When RBI said today that inflation will be 4.5% next quarter, they decided not to focus on \u201cinflation projection\u201d but at the \u201ccurrent inflation\u201d. We believe it\u2019s because of rupee risk. An easy monetary policy can only lead to further pressure on the rupee, and the RBI must remain cautious. Gov Das couldn\u2019t have spelled the rupee risks in the policy as that would have put more pressure. Despite what RBI says, the rupee risks remain dominant on RBI as evidenced by the increase in FCNR rates. All in all, before going into the policy the market was divided. Thus, post policy there will be critics and proponents. For us, we think it was a balanced policy - hedging all the risks.

Here are the details. The central bank on December 5 said that Canara Bank could now offload stake in its asset management and insurance firms. Status quo on Repo rate, Feb cut likely: RBI had not cut rate so far citing high headline inflation as the reason, while ignoring growth concerns. Our understanding that food inflation won\u2019t generalise into core inflation has proved right as core inflation has remained under 4%. 2Q GDP growth slowed considerably (though it had several one-offs), and we have been highlighting that a rate cut was much needed to support growth. However, global macro setting has changed post Trump\u2019s victory and new risks loom over world economy. USD has strengthened against EM currencies and RBI is intervening actively to support INR as evident by depleting FX reserves. If USD continues to strengthen, FII selling from EMs will further exacerbate. Trump\u2019s potential plan to impose 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports can lead to China devaluing Yuan, followed by devaluation by other EMs, eventually triggering a currency crisis. India\u2019s inflation preparedness is relatively poor, and any sharp currency devaluation could immediately turn up inflation. Hence, we now expect modest rate cuts starting Feb 2025.\u00a0 Liquidity management crucial, CRR cut a possibility: Banks credit growth moderated to 11.7% yoy in Nov and growth is slowing down across the board. Private consumption has slowed down too in 2Q. To stimulate growth, RBI should cut CRR by 50bps and bring it back to pre-covid level of 4%. Banking system surplus liquidity has been declining lately and a CRR cut will ensure durable liquidity is infused into the system and will better facilitate the transmission of repo rate cut in Feb. Outlook on inflation and GDP: Inflation is expected to moderate by 4QFY25 as Kharif harvest is going to be good. Core inflation has remained under 4% for long. Still, RBI may up its FY25 inflation forecast from 4.5% currently by 20-30bps as inflation was higher than expected in recent months. On the growth front, we expect a downward revision of 20-30bps in RBI\u2019s FY25 growth estimates from current 7.2%, as 2Q numbers missed estimates by wide margin.

The chain\u2019s move also includes a $350\u00a0million revolving credit facility. The deal, overseen by Barclays,\u00a0Deutsche Bank, JP\u00a0Morgan,\u00a0Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Texas Capital, marks the latest financial rework by the chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRegal Inks Multiyear Deal With Fandango On Advertising, Concessions Sales\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\tBusiness\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRegal Plans to Upgrade Its Movie Theaters With $250M Capital Raise\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\tRegal also disclosed that it saw $1 billion-plus in total revenue and 49 million moviegoers at its locations in its most recent quarter, driven by titles like Inside Out 2,\u00a0Deadpool & Wolverine,\u00a0Despicable Me 4,\u00a0Twisters and The Wild Robot.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\tIn July, Regal said it had secured $250 million to give its theaters an upgrade and refurbish its already existing locations (425 theaters across the country) with luxury recliners and other amenities. The company\u2019s owner, Cineworld, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 2022 and emerged from its restructuring process last year. \n\t\u201cThe overwhelmingly positive\u00a0market reception for this\u00a0transaction is a\u00a0signal of the\u00a0momentum we are seeing in our business,\u201d said Eduardo Acuna, CEO at Regal Cineworld. \u201cIn Q3, Regal Cineworld welcomed over\u00a049 million guests to our theatres and generated total revenue of\u00a0over\u00a0$1 billion dollars with record-high\u00a0levels of spend per person on concessions. With the refinancing transaction, we will save $60 million per year in interest expense, which puts our\u00a0successful\u00a0restructuring squarely in the past.\u201d \n\tSo far in 2024, total domestic box office sits at $7.78 billion through Dec. 1, per Comscore figures. That tally is about 6.3 percent behind the $8.3 billion in grosses that theaters in the U.S. and Canada saw by this time last year. \n\tThe Thanksgiving corridor saw blockbuster returns for multiple chains as Moana, Wicked and Gladiator II hit the big screen. AMC Theatres, the largest circuit globally, said 8.8 million moviegoers saw a feature at its locations in the U.S. and Odeon Cinemas internationally from Nov. 27 through Dec. 1. Cinemark, the third-largest exhibitor in the states, touted that it saw its second-best November domestic box office performance in the company\u2019s history.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Send us a tip using our anonymous form."},{"source":"CNN","author":"Juliana Liu","title":"US Steel: Trump again vows to block Japanese firm\u2019s controversial takeover","description":"President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly said he intends to block a Japanese firm\u2019s $15 billion takeover bid of US Steel upon taking office, saying the former American giant can eventually stand on its own.","url":"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2024\/12\/02\/business\/trump-block-us-nippon-steel-hnk-intl\/index.html","published_at":"2024-12-03T05:18:26Z","content":"Markets \n\n\n Hot Stocks \n\n\n Fear & Greed Index \n\n\n \n            Latest Market News \n\n\n \n            Hot Stocks \n\n\n Follow: \n            President-elect Donald Trump has again indicated that he intends to block a Japanese firm\u2019s $15 billion takeover bid of US Steel upon taking office, saying the former American giant can eventually stand on its own.\n     \n            \u201cThrough a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs, we will make U.S. Steel Strong and Great Again,\u201d he said on his Truth Social platform on Monday. \u201cAs President, I will block this deal from happening. Buyer Beware!!\u201d\n     \n            The intended buyer, Nippon Steel, said it was determined to protect and grow US Steel.\n     \n            \u201cWe will invest no less than $2.7 billion into its unionized facilities, introduce our world-class technological innovation, and secure union jobs so that American steelworkers at US Steel can manufacture the most advanced steel products for American customers,\u201d it said in a statement sent to CNN.\n     \n            The United Steelworkers union, which endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president, said Tuesday it supported Trump\u2019s opposition to the deal, writing in a statement: \u201cThe USW welcomes President Trump\u2019s continued opposition to Nippon Steel\u2019s acquisition of U.S. Steel, a deal with serious long-term implications for U.S. economic and national security.\u201d\n     \n            \u201cIt\u2019s clear that President Trump understands the vital role a strong domestic steel industry plays in our national security, as well as the importance of the jobs and communities the industry supports,\u201d USW international president David McCall wrote.\n     \n            The Pittsburgh-based company was formed in 1901 as a merger of the nation\u2019s leading steel companies, including Carnegie Steel Corp, engineered by financiers JP Morgan and Charles Schwab. The new company became the world\u2019s first to be valued at more than $1 billion.\n     \n            But in recent years, US Steel has fallen far below other American steel companies in output and stock market value. And the US steel industry is a shell of its former self, with no company among the 10 largest steel producers around the globe.\n     \n            In September, Nippon Steel was expected to re-file its application for a national security review by American regulators, buying Japan\u2019s largest steelmaker another 90 days to close its acquisition of a US rival after political opposition emerged in an election year.\n     \n            The surprise development allowed the steelmakers to reset the clock, potentially keeping the controversial deal alive. But Trump, then the Republican presidential nominee, as well as President Joe Biden and Harris, had all voiced their opposition.\n     \n            The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a team of Cabinet-level appointees that reviews all deals of a certain size involving US entities, had been studying the takeover of US Steel for several months on the grounds of national security.\n     \n            With the White House signaling it would block the deal, and CFIUS officials wanting to operate outside the pressure of political calendars, an extension of the timeline seemed the best outcome, CNN has previously reported.\n     \n            US Steel said in September it would be forced to lay off workers and shutter mills without Nippon\u2019s backing. It had put itself up for sale last year after receiving an unsolicited $7 billion takeover offer from Ohio-based Cleveland Cliffs. The $14.9 billion offer from Nippon Steel resulted from that sale process.\n     \n  \u2014 CNN\u2019s Yumi Asada contributed reporting.\n Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Along with this, the chances of Fed going for another rate cut has dimmed, which has given further support to the US Dollar Index, thereby negatively affecting gold prices. Domestically, the correction is here for the better as India enters the wedding season, one of the two biggest gold-buying seasons in the country. Given the sentimental value attached to the yellow metal, price factor plays a minimal role in influencing the buyer\u2019s decision, keeping the overall demand robust.

(Post market) (Sector- Technology) BHP Group Limited (TENT) (Sector- Metals) 07:15 China manufacturing PMI (Expected: 50.3 vs Previous: 50.3) 10:30 India manufacturing PMI (Expected: 57.3 vs Previous: 57.5) 14:30 Euro manufacturing PMI (Expected: 45.2 vs Previous: 45.2) 15:00 U.K. manufacturing PMI (Expected: 48.6 vs Previous: 48.6) 19:30 U.S. ISM manufacturing PMI (Expected: 47.3 vs Previous: 46.5) India\u2019s GDP growth for Q2 FY2024-25 slowed significantly to 5.4%, below expectations, reflecting weakened manufacturing, consumption, and private investments. GVA grew modestly at 5.6%, with manufacturing dipping to 2.2% and inflation eroding urban demand. However, agriculture provided some relief, rising 3.5%, aided by favorable monsoons. After the announcement, G-sec yields fell across maturities, with the 1-year OIS dropping from 6.5075% to 6.3625%, and the 2-year OIS dropping from 6.2350% to 6.0375% signaling an increased likelihood of rate cuts. Bond yields also declined, with the old and new 10Y yields, for instance, dropping by 6 bps.\u00a0 The contraction in manufacturing growth and weaker consumption data likely contributed to expectations of RBI intervention. The decline in OIS rates further suggests the market\u2019s anticipation of easier monetary policy. The slowdown has intensified pressure on the RBI to consider interest rate cuts to support growth. Policymakers are optimistic about rural demand stabilizing the economy, but a sharp rebound is necessary to meet annual growth projections. The weekend brought bad macro news for the market \u2013 a weak GDP print, uninspiring fiscal data, and a Trump tariff threat to BRICS. This should trigger some near-term weakness in the markets, but some of this was already known and partially priced in. We do not see the case for a major market sell-off but reiterate that near-term upside is also limited due to earnings weakness and valuations. We keep our Dec-25E Nifty target unchanged at 25,000. An incremental correction over 5% in the Nifty is an entry opportunity, in our view. GDP miss known and partially priced in The weak earnings season, with the BSE-500 delivering zero YoY earnings growth, already told us that the economy faced a growth challenge in 2QFY25. The market absorbed that information with an 8% fall in the BSE-500 since 28-Sep and a 2.5% cut in Nifty earnings forecasts for FY25. Beyond the sticker-shock impact, we do not see this as incrementally game-changing news. Penciling-in a capex recovery We have penciled-in a 2HFY25 recovery, but it is likely to be led by central government capex. Spending is behind the curve and the mathematical 61% YoY asking rate for Nov-24 to Mar-25 puts the annual target at risk. However, we expect a sharp sequential pick-up in sectors like defense and railways. The sharp decline in government balances is an indicator of this. Channel checks also indicate that the government has started to disburse pending balances, which is trickling into incremental demand. Consumption demand \u2013 sluggish for 2H Consumption demand has been disappointing for 1HFY25 and we think the recovery will be pushed into FY26. There have been multiple macro challenges \u2013 high base, weak jobs market, and credit tightening by the RBI. Our expectations of a mass category consumption revival also appears to have been belied with FMCG companies reporting weak numbers. We believe these are temporary factors but a turnaround will take at least 2-3 quarters and a revival seen only in FY26. Ball in RBI\u2019s court A silver lining is that the weak growth opens the door for an RBI rate cut in Dec-24. There are challenges, however: inflation is still running hot at over 6% and the DXY strength puts the RBI in a tricky spot for the next 1-2 quarters. Trump\u2019s threats to retaliate with sanctions on BRICS countries attempting de-dollarization add to the uncertainty. We believe that rate cuts will anyway have a limited impact as leverage levels are low. An RBI rethink of lending curbs on banks and NBFCs, however, would have a more meaningful impact. Sectoral preferences We would stay away from consumer-led sectors due to our expectations of a delayed revival in consumption vs capex. Our key OW remain IT\/Energy\/Materials\/Utilities whereas we remain UW on Staples. We see a tactical opportunity in Financials but would use the rally to sell, as we remain structurally UW on the sector In the last week, emotions ran high as the market moved sharply up on Monday and the gains were negated by a sharp fall on Thursday. The underlying news events were just as conflicting - optimism prevailed after the Maharashtra election results but the allegations about the Adani group raised concerns among investors. On Friday, the excitement in the Pharma and Auto stocks helped the Nifty close up 0.91% at 24,131.10 while the S&P BSE Sensex settled 0.96% higher at 759.05 points. The market\u2019s apparent discounting of the anticipated slowdown in India\u2019s Q2 GDP to 6.5% suggests that traders are looking beyond short-term economic data and focusing on the longer-term growth prospects of the Indian economy. We are starting the forthcoming week with conflicting events. The Maharashtra election results gave a clear mandate to the Mahayuti alliance, but it has shown uncertainty regarding the leadership pick of the Chief Minister. Adani stocks have mostly recovered from the rout in earlier week but a new concern emerged about the GDP slump. The GDP growth number has come down to 5.4%, compared to 8.1% in the corresponding quarter a year back. The candlestick pattern suggests the nearest resistance level at 24,350-24,360 for the index. Many traders will likely be hesitant to buy above this level, remembering past failures to break through this resistance. A breakout above this level could trigger a wave of buying, fueled by the fear of missing out (FOMO). As long as the index remains below 24,360, short-term traders may book profits on any bounce and wait for a fresh breakout. Holding on to positions for too long, hoping for further gains, can be detrimental if the market reverses its course. Global markets are grappling with anxieties stemming from geopolitical tensions and uncertainties surrounding the U.S. Fed\u2019s interest rate decisions. The possibility of changing global trade dynamics under President-elect Donald Trump, particularly due to the threat of U.S. tariffs, is further adding to the global market unease. The Indian rupee, while ending Friday relatively flat at 84.4825, remains precariously close to its all-time low of 84.5075, reached just last week. In contrast to the anxieties impacting Asian markets and currencies, the U.S. dollar has experienced a surge, mirroring a similar upward trend in U.S. yields, ever since Donald Trump\u2019s election victory in early November. Though Nifty has shown strength in the last week, the medium-term trend remains weak. From its September high of around 26,277, the Nifty is still down almost 12%. Novice traders often confuse short-term and long-term trends, potentially leading them to make impulsive decisions during these consolidations. It is crucial to remember that the market is designed to exploit such mistakes. Traders should focus on managing positions with a pre-determined strategy, rather than trying to predict every short-term fluctuation.

Prospective data (January 2010-August 2022) were drawn from an open cohort of 900+ women sex workers. We developed multivariable logistic regression confounder models with generalized estimating equations (GEE) to examine associations between social cohesion and recent (1) physical\/sexual violence and (2) engagement with sex work-specific services. Of 918 participants, 36.8% were Indigenous and 32.1% were Black\/Women of Colour. At baseline, the median social cohesion score was 19 (IQR 16\u201322), out of 36, with higher levels among participants who work with other sex workers. In separate multivariable confounder models with GEE, social cohesion was associated with lower odds of recent physical\/sexual violence (Adjusted Odds Ratio 0.98 per point on scale, 95% Confidence Interval 0.97, 0.99) and recent use of sex work-specific services, although only statistically significant for physical\/sexual violence. Findings support the need to eliminate policing of work environments that promote sex workers\u2019 social cohesion and physical safety through full decriminalization.

Due to ongoing criminalization, state violence and stigma, mutual aid has particular necessity within sex worker organizing, and has remained essential to sex workers\u2019 occupational health and safety (OHS), and wellbeing [3\u20135]. In the context of communal work environments (e.g., formal work venues, shared in-call spaces) or spatial proximity (common outdoor strolls), peer education, skill and resource sharing helps workers survive the gaps bad policy creates [6]. Within massage parlours, in clubs and on sets, sex workers help each other with shooting online content (e.g. photos, videos) and posting advertisements [5]. Spotting, providing condoms and sexual health education are everyday acts of peer support for outdoor and indoor workers [7, 8]. However, stigma and criminalization, including end-demand sex work laws, also hinder sex workers\u2019 engagement with mutual aid (by limiting shared workspaces, use of condoms as evidence, censoring online resources, e.g.). In this cyclical manner, mutual aid among sex workers is based on meeting urgent and everyday needs, while advocating for law reform and systems-level change. While \u2018mutual aid\u2019 is a broader, historical and political concept, social cohesion exists within mutual aid to specifically capture experiences and perceptions of resource sharing, trust and connectedness, predominantly among communities who work or live in the same setting [9, 10]. Indicators of social cohesion include: being able to rely on other sex workers for tangible (e.g., money or a place to stay) or emotional support, and that workers get along well with each other. In the global south, established best practices for advancing sex workers\u2019 OHS include community empowerment programs that strengthen social cohesion [11]. Much of the existing research has focused on social cohesion among sex workers who share physical workspaces or participate in a local peer support program, with a focus on condom access and sexual health status [12\u201314]. Global research led by NSWP has expanded the use of social cohesion by identifying the potential of online spaces in supporting and reshaping sex workers\u2019 social cohesion beyond physical work environments [15]. However, there remains opportunity to identify the impacts of social cohesion on sex workers\u2019 diverse needs and priorities, and across diverse settings and criminalization models. In the North American context, epidemiologic research assessing sex work social cohesion has largely focused on sexual health outcomes, finding high social cohesion linked with reduced client condom refusal, increased condom use for pregnancy prevention, and reduced odds of STI seropositivity [16\u201318]. In settings such as Canada, where sex workers and their work environments are extremely diverse, but also remain highly criminalized, there remains opportunity to identify a range of OHS benefits of social cohesion, and address what barriers remain. In 2014, the Canadian federal government implemented \u2018end-demand\u2019 criminalization (the Protection of Exploited Persons and Communities Act). These laws take aim at the demand for sex work\u2014criminalizing clients and third party activities\u2014and frame sex workers as victims of violence and exploitation, rather than as workers with rights and needs for occupational protections [19]. This end-demand approach has been adopted by an increasing number of global jurisdictions (e.g. Norway, Sweden, France) [20\u201322], and continues to be considered for implementation in additional settings, most recently in Scotland [23]. Despite popularity among lawmakers, end-demand approaches have been shown to have severe consequences for sex workers\u2019 occupational conditions [22, 24] and perpetuate disproportionate policing and surveillance of sex work communities and their workspaces [25, 26]. Given the potential implications of the expansion of the end-demand regime, it is necessary to examine sex workers\u2019 access to social cohesion within the context of end-demand, including settings such as Canada. Therefore, aims of this study were to: 1. measure social cohesion (last 6 months), defined as perceived mutual aid, trust and support with other sex workers; and 2. identify the association between social cohesion (last 6 months) with a) sexual\/physical violence, and b) engagement with sex work-specific services (e.g., drop-in spaces, harm reduction outreach) in the last 6 months among a large, diverse cohort of women sex workers in Metro Vancouver, Canada. This study recognizes sex work as not inherently violent or a health risk, but rather \u201ca form of labour strongly shaped by intersecting structural factors\u201d [27]. Our analysis is based on the understanding that sex work OHS is shaped by criminalization and policing, compounded by intersecting systems of oppression, and conditioned by work environments. By utilizing a structural determinants of health framework previously applied to sex workers\u2019 OHS access [28], this analysis centres the diversity in lived experience and the interplay between structural factors at the macro, community, and work environment level. Macrostructural determinants include: social and economic systems governing sex work including punitive sex work laws [22]; immigration laws [29]; policing [30]; capitalism; colonialism and white supremacy [31]; patriarchy, transphobia and heteronormativism [32]; and stigma. Community level determinants include access to community-based outreach and services, and community participation (e.g., volunteering or peer work) [33]. Work environment level determinants include physical, social, policy, and economic features, such as type of work environment (indoor\/outdoor), venue-based policies and collaboration between sex workers. This study draws on data from a community-based open prospective cohort, An Evaluation of Sex Workers Health Access (AESHA) which is based on community collaborations since 2005 and initiated recruitment in January 2010. Eligibility at baseline include identifying as a woman\/femme while working, having exchanged sex for money in the last month, aged 14 and above, and able to provide informed consent. As previously described, our recruitment criteria are inclusive of diverse and fluid identities while capturing the ways that patriarchal gender norms shape participants\u2019 experiences in sex work [27]. Eligibility is inclusive of cis and transgender women, transexual women and other transfeminine identities at enrolment. As previously described [27, 33], time-location sampling was used to recruit participants through daytime and late-night (9 pm\u20132 am) outreach to outdoor sex work locations (e.g., streets, alleys) and indoor sex work venues (e.g., massage parlors, micro-brothels) across Metro Vancouver, BC. Online recruitment was also used to reach sex workers utilizing online solicitation spaces. Indoor and outdoor work environments are identified through community mapping and updated regularly by the outreach team. Since inception, current and former sex workers make up the research team, from research assistants and interviewers\/outreach workers to coordinators. Participant recruitment completed on September 1, 2023. Further detail on AESHA\u2019s origins is available in previous publications [34]. After obtaining informed consent, participants complete interviewer-administered questionnaires administered via REDCap [35] at baseline and semi-annual follow-up visits, eliciting responses on individual characteristics, work environments, structural factors, and health access and outcomes. Interviews are conducted at a study office in Vancouver or a confidential space of participants\u2019 preference (e.g., home, work location). Currently, participants receive $80 Canadian at baseline and $65 at each follow-up for their time, expertise and travel. At each study visit, participants are offered voluntary HIV\/STI\/HCV testing and counseling by the sexual health research nurse and are offered referrals or STI treatment onsite, as needed and appropriate. Ethical approval for this study is provided by the Providence Health Care\/University of British Columbia Research Ethics Board (REB number H09-02803). The main variable of interest was \u2018social cohesion\u2019, first assessed among sex workers in settings including India and Brazil, using a Social Cohesion Scale, a multi-item index that measures levels of perceived resource sharing, trust, solidarity and support among sex workers [10]. The scale has been previously adapted and validated with sex workers in Canada as part of AESHA, where a high level of internal consistency was indicated (Cronbach a = 0.919) [16, 17]. As described in previous AESHA publications [16], social cohesion among participants in the current study was based on a response to 12 items on a four-point scale ranging from strongly agree (3 points) to strongly disagree (0 points). Measures of social cohesion included items relating to being able to rely on other sex workers for money, advice, and a place to stay; social support when visiting a doctor; help with finding clients; help with violent perpetrators; and a sense that workers get along well with each other. The 12 item scores were summed to create a continuous measure for social cohesion, with a lowest possible score of 0, and a maximum possible score of 36. Social Cohesion was used as the outcome variable in Objective 1, and as the primary exposure of interest in Objective 2. For objective 2, time-updated OHS outcomes of interest included 1) sexual\/physical violence and 2) engagement with sex work-specific services, in the last 6 months. Recent experiences of sexual\/physical violence was defined as reporting any experiences of sexual or physical violence by any perpetrator (e.g., aggressors posing as clients, intimate partners, police), in the last six months. Recent engagement with sex work-specific services was defined by reporting engagement with or access of any sex work-specific services in Metro Vancouver (e.g., mobile outreach, drop-in spaces led by or tailored to sex workers providing harm reduction, peer support), in the last six months. Other explanatory variables of interest were selected a priori based on our theoretical framework, and literature related to sex work social cohesion and sex workers\u2019 health and safety. All variables are derived from our study questionnaire and have been defined similarly in previous analyses [27, 33]. Individual-level variables included age (continuous), years in sex work (continuous), HIV seropositivity, and time-updated variables capturing experiences in the last six months, including any non-injection drug use (excluding alcohol and cannabis), any injection drug use, as well as good self-rated health. Macrostructural variables included racialization and Indigenous identity to examine the effects of colonization and racism, defined as Indigenous (inclusive of First Nations, M\u00e9tis, or Inuit), Black\/Women of Colour (e.g., East Asian, Southeast Asian) vs. white. Given the low proportion of participants who identified as Black in our sample (which is consistent with the Black population of BC (<2%)), we combined Black and Women of Colour to examine effects of racism among this group. We also considered mental health diagnoses, high school attainment, im\/migration to Canada, sexual minority identity (gay, lesbian, bisexual, asexual, queer, other vs. heterosexual), and gender identity (cis women vs trans women, including, transgender women, transexual women and other transfeminine identities). Other structural variables included lifetime experiences of incarceration. All remaining structural variables captured experiences in the last 6 months, including: any police harassment while working, any unstable housing (i.e., living in an SRO, supportive housing, etc. vs. living in own apartment\/house), and any barriers to healthcare. Community and work environment level variables included primary place servicing clients in the last six months (work environment level), including outdoor\/public (e.g., street, public washroom, car, tent), and informal (e.g., own or client\u2019s place of residence) or formal indoor spaces (e.g., massage\/beauty parlour, micro-brothel). This variable included a category for no recent sex work, as not all participants actively do sex work at every semi-annual study visit. Other work environment-level variables included having worked with other sex workers as a safety strategy. Baseline descriptive statistics for independent variables were calculated as frequencies and proportions for categorical variables and measures of central tendencies (i.e., mean, median, interquartile range (IQR)) for continuous variables. We next conducted bivariate analysis using linear regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE) and an exchangeable correlation matrix [36] to examine associations between social cohesion and individual and structural variables of interest over the study period. GEE was used to account for repeated measurements over time among the same participants. We subsequently developed two separate multivariable confounder models using logistic regression with GEE to identify the independent association between social cohesion and outcomes of (1) sexual\/physical violence, and (2) engagement with sex work-specific services. We used GEE to address the clustered nature of repeated observations among the same participants across study visits. Correlations due to repeated measure was handled through a correlation matrix. Hypothesized confounders that were included in the full model included age, sexual minority at any study visit, racialization, primary place servicing clients, recent unstable housing, recent inconsistent condom use with clients, recent police harassment and recent non-injection drug use. To account for the noncollapsibility effect when using logistic regression [37], we also conducted a sensitivity analysis using manual backward selection on confounders. The equation and code underlying the GEE analysis can be found in Appendix 1 [S1 File]. Analyses were performed in SAS version 9.4 (SAS, Cary, NC), 95% confidence intervals are presented, and all p-values are two-sided. Missing data were handled using a complete case approach. Analyses included 4179 observations collected amongst 918 participants from January 2010 \u2013August 2022. Among participants, 338 (36.8%) were Indigenous and 295 (32.1%) identified as Black\/Women of Colour. At baseline, 38.1% (n = 350) serviced clients in outdoor spaces, while 27.1%, (n = 249) serviced clients in informal indoor spaces (e.g., apartments), and 32.6% (n = 299) in formal in-call spaces. 35.7% of participants reported having experienced any recent physical\/sexual violence. As well, a majority of participants (57.6%) recently engaged with sex work-specific services (e.g., mobile outreach, drop-in spaces led by or tailored to sex workers providing harm reduction, peer support). At baseline, the median social cohesion score was 19 (IQR 16\u201322), out of a possible 36 (Table 1).  \n              https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0314749.t001 In bivariable GEE analysis, increased social cohesion was associated with formal indoor work environments (3.43 per point increase on scale, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 2.82, 4.03), good self-rated health (0.74 per point increase on scale, 95% CI 0.41, 1.07), and working with other sex workers as a safety strategy (1.89 per point increase on scale, 95% CI 1.56, 2.22) (Table 2).  \n              https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0314749.t002 In separate multivariable GEE confounder models (Table 3) adjusted for key confounders, increased social cohesion was associated with lower odds of recent physical\/sexual violence (Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 0.98 per point on scale; 95% CI 0.97, 1.00; p = 0.025) and recent use of sex work-specific services (aOR 1.00 per point on scale, 95% CI 0.98, 1.01; p = 0.829).  \n              https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0314749.t003 This study addressed social cohesion\u2013perceptions of resource sharing, trust and support\u2013over twelve years in a cohort of sex workers across diverse work environments. Among our sample of sex workers based in Metro Vancouver, increased social cohesion was associated with lower odds of recent physical\/sexual violence and increased odds of recently using sex work-specific services, although this was only statistically significant for recent physical\/sexual violence. Overall, we found mid to high levels of social cohesion, consistent with findings across global settings, while revealing increased social cohesion among sex workers who work in formal indoor work environments, and who work with others as a safety strategy. When measuring social cohesion among a diverse cohort of women sex workers, our study found high levels of social cohesion among those who service clients in formal, indoor venues (e.g. massage parlours), as well as among im\/migrant sex workers, who are more likely to work within such spaces [38]. Previous research has found that im\/migrant sex workers face unique barriers to more formalized community engagement models and sex work-specific services due to compounding criminalization, language barriers, and exacerbated stigma [33, 39]. However, our research suggests that working in communal spaces and in collaboration with peers facilitates social cohesion and can support trust-building among sex workers. At the same time, a plethora of research has demonstrated the high levels of racialized policing faced by formal indoor venues [38, 39], which limit sex workers\u2019 access to sex work- specific services as well as general health services [40, 41]. Recent research with sex workers and third parties in Metro Vancouver has found that peer support within collaborative work environments is necessary for filling gaps related to sexual health education, harm reduction, and support for sex workers who experience violence [8]. While our current study demonstrates the benefits of collaborative workspaces in promoting social cohesion, there remains an urgent need to address the policies that create these support gaps. Additionally, when measuring social cohesion levels among sex workers, we found high scores among participants who reported working with other sex workers as a safety strategy. Working in isolation, indoors and outdoors, has been shown to increase sex workers\u2019 risk of violence [42\u201344], while leaning on other sex workers who act as spotters, or knowing that other workers are nearby, has helped sex workers exert more agency and negotiate boundaries [7, 45]. Despite the OHS benefits of collaborative workspaces, criminalization continues to isolate sex workers across diverse work environments. Previous Vancouver-based research has found outdoor sex work spaces face high levels of police surveillance due to the overlapping criminalization of sex work, drug use and poverty, forcing sex workers to work in secluded areas and away from other workers and sex work-specific services [42, 43, 46]. In the context of Vancouver, precarious or low-income workers, unhoused communities, and people living in single-room occupancy buildings, including many sex workers, are also being severely impacted by an ongoing housing crisis and city-enforced evictions and destruction of encampments [47, 48]. All of which impact sex workers\u2019 access to collaborative and\/or supportive outdoor and indoor work environments. Additionally, end-demand sex work laws criminalize collaborative indoor workspaces, and perpetuate fear of criminalization for sex workers who offer peer support. Our study builds on existing research and community knowledge by demonstrating the potential of collaborative work environments in promoting social cohesion and associated OHS benefits, including safety and access to services. Lastly, we found that social cohesion was associated with lower odds of recent physical or sexual violence, echoing previous research in the global south which has shown that social cohesion among sex workers plays a critical role in supporting safety [10, 14]. For example, in Jamacia, where sex work is partially criminalised yet highly policed, social cohesion has been linked to reduced odds of violence and harassment experienced by sex workers, including client and intimate partner violence, as well as police violence [14]. Our study builds on this body of work by providing some of the first quantitative data on associations of social cohesion and violence within the North American context, and is the first to explore role of social cohesion in shaping sex workers\u2019 experiences of violence under end-demand laws. While bivariate analysis demonstrated that sex workers reporting higher social cohesion faced increased odds of using sex worker-specific services, this effect did not retain statistical significance after adjustment for confounding. Our descriptive and bivariate findings build on community knowledge that when sex workers are able to work collaboratively, they are more likely to receive support and service referrals, engage in advocacy, and are better connected to the broader community [4, 5]. All of these have been linked to improved safety and wellbeing [7, 33, 49]. Ongoing barriers to sex worker social cohesion and collectivization in the context of Canada\u2019s end-demand laws point to the need for full decriminalization of sex work, as recommended by sex worker-led organizations in Canada and globally [24, 50]. In a global review of sex work criminalization models, repressive policing of sex workers under partial or end-demand criminalization was associated with working in isolation and reduced OHS outcomes [22]. Whereas in decriminalized settings such as New Zealand, sex workers have experienced a reduced threat of arrest and harmful police interactions [51], and increased access to supportive workspaces [52]. By demonstrating the limitations of social cohesion under end-demand, our findings bring further attention to the ongoing call for full decriminalization, and an end to police surveillance of sex workers and their work environments, as a necessary first step in promoting social cohesion and ensuring sex workers have equal access to safe, collaborative work environments and tailored services. Strengths of this study include its prospective nature, strong community collaborations, a large, diverse sample, and use of a validated and adapted scale as our primary outcome variable. Our framing and literature review draws heavily on literature and knowledge produced by current and former sex workers. Still, several limitations remain. This research cannot infer causality, and all data are self-reported. As with most research involving stigmatised populations, there is potential for social desirability and recall bias. However, our community-based and experiential team, training in non-stigmatising interview techniques are designed to mitigate this. The weekly time-location outreach conducted by our interview team, and frequent check-ins with participants help minimize loss to follow up. Time\u2013location sampling also helped ensure a representative sample and minimize selection bias, however, findings may not be fully generalizable to all sex worker populations, including Black and Latinx sex workers, and those with diverse gender identities including men, masc and non binary sex workers. Further research is needed to explore the role of gender identify in shaping social cohesion, and which engages more diverse groups of women of colour sex workers, to address the impacts of diverse forms of racism on sex workers\u2019 social cohesion. Finally, this analysis used GEE to model the clustered nature of the data (repeated measures across the same participants over time); we conducted sensitivity analyses using GLMM, which yielded similar results. In summary, we identified an association between social cohesion and (a) reduced odds of physical\/sexual violence, and (b) increased odds of engagement with sex work-specific services over 12 years in a diverse cohort of sex workers in Vancouver, Canada. However, this effect was only shown to be statistically significant after adjustment for confounding for the physical\/sexual violence outcome. Our study is among the first to demonstrate outcomes linked to social cohesion beyond condom negotiation and sexual health status, as well as situate social cohesion within the broader legacy of mutual aid among sex work communities, and provide critical data on the relationship between social cohesion and sex workers\u2019 OHS in a North American and end-demand context. Our results highlight the role of collaboration in supporting social cohesion, as well as sex workers\u2019 collective strength and ability to care for one another. As well, by more broadly exploring social cohesion as a primary outcome variable, we were able to identify work environments and strategies that support higher levels of social cohesion, including formal indoor work environments and working with other sex workers as a safety strategy. This research supports the need to scale up sex work co-working spaces, in addition to safe and dignified housing options, as well as increase access to digital technologies that allow for greater communication and sharing of resources among sex workers. Lastly, the current research demonstrates a critical need to eliminate policing and state surveillance of sex work, through full decriminalization, including sex worker collectivization and indoor and outdoor workspaces, to better promote sex workers\u2019 social cohesion, safety and access to tailored, sex worker-led services.

Toka, an Israeli startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz, specializes in this type of work. It previously gained attention for a 2022 Haaretz article detailing its claims about being able to obtain and even delete security camera footage. The company is now looking to hire a \u201cClient Director USA\u201d to \u201csupport new business growth within the US government market.\u201d The position requires a \u201cstrong history of technology sales within DoD and national security agencies.\u201d Toka is also seeking a customer success engineer under its North America team that is responsible for helping its clients with \u201cdeployment, training, and enablement.\u201d Experience working with federal law enforcement is considered an advantage. Toka told TechCrunch it is \u201cmostly filling open slots\u201d and declined to comment further on its U.S. government activities.\u00a0 \u201cWhat we can say is that Toka only sells to militaries, homeland security organizations, intelligence, and law enforcement agencies in the United States and its closest allies who use our products in compliance with local laws,\u201d a company spokesman said. Hacking IoT products is becoming increasingly common in the murky defense and intelligence worlds.\u00a0 Israel, where Toka is headquartered, has gained some renown for this kind of intelligence-gathering. Hezbollah warned Lebanese residents earlier this year to turn off their security cameras to prevent Israel from hacking into them to spot targets. But this kind of tech doesn\u2019t have to be limited to war zones. TechCrunch reported last month that a16z\u2019s Ben Horowitz tried to donate funds to the Las Vegas Police Department for purchasing Toka software. They didn\u2019t take him up on it, a Toka spokesman said. Toka has publicly raised $37.5 million since its founding in 2018 from investors like a16z, Dell Capital, and others. Haaretz previously reported in 2022 that Toka was seeking to work with U.S. Special Forces and an unnamed U.S. intelligence agency. Toka has sought to avoid scrutiny on Israeli spyware outfits like the U.S.-sanctioned NSO Group, publicly promising that it only does business with governments from a \u201cselect list of countries\u201d with good track records on civil liberties and corruption. Toka is listed as attending a conference in the UAE in 2021 and earlier this year hired a vice president of international sales who previously worked for Cellebrite, another controversial Israeli cyber firm. But Toka told TechCrunch it doesn\u2019t have any clients in the UAE and monitors its international sales closely. \u201cWe regularly review this select list of countries, using outside assessments on a range of issues, including civil liberties, rule of law, and corruption,\u201d Toka\u2019s spokesman said. \u201cAssisting us in this process are two distinguished outside advisers: Professor Peter Schuck of Yale Law School and Israel Prize-winner Jacob Frenkel, currently Chairman of JP Morgan Chase International and a former IMF official.\u201d Topics  OpenAI\u2019s Sora video generator is launching for ChatGPT Pro and Plus subscribers \u2014 but not in the EU\n  Bluesky teases paid subscription, Bluesky+, in new mockup\n  OpenAI\u2019s Sora is launching today \u2014 here are highlights from the first review\n  Troubled electric truckmaker Nikola offers up to $100 million in common stock\n  It\u2019s a Raspberry Pi 5 in a keyboard, and it\u2019s called the Raspberry Pi 500\n  Apple sued over abandoning CSAM detection for iCloud\n  Elon Musk\u2019s X gains a new image generator, Aurora\n \nSenior Reporter\n Subscribe for the industry\u2019s biggest tech news Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch\u2019s coverage.

The savings are then used for conservation or climate-related projects.","url":"https:\/\/www.rappler.com\/world\/global-affairs\/countries-completed-debt-swaps-nature-climate\/","published_at":"2024-12-05T06:53:48Z","content":"SUMMARY This is AI generated summarization, which may have errors. For context, always refer to the full article. LONDON, United Kingdom \u2013 Debt swaps are becoming a more widely used tool to help indebted countries raise money for conservation or climate-related projects. Under a swap, a country buys back more expensive debt and replaces it with cheaper debt, usually with the help of a development bank. The savings are then used for environmental projects that restore mangroves or protect oceans, or help adapt to the impacts of climate change. Here is a list of countries which have completed them in recent years. Barbados combined an almost $300 million buy-back of its domestic bonds with upfront funding from the Inter-American Development Bank and Green Climate Fund to complete the world\u2019s first swap focused on climate resilience. The wide-reaching project will see Barbados invest $165 million in water infrastructure, food security and environmental protection to help the Caribbean island adapt to the damaging effects of climate change. The Bahamas unlocked more than $120 million in November to fund the conservation and management of its oceans and mangroves with a $300 million debt swap financed by Standard Chartered and backed by the private sector. Funding from the swap, designed by nonprofit The Nature Conservancy which also provides conservation support to the Bahamas, will go towards restoring mangroves damaged by the hurricane, managing the archipelago\u2019s 6.8 million hectares (16.8 million acres) of marine protected areas and supporting the build-out of a new project to protect the entire Bahamian ocean area El Salvador freed up $352 million in October to fund the conservation of the Rio Lempa, the country\u2019s main river and its watershed. At the time, the deal was the largest funding commitment a country had made for conservation as part of a debt-for-nature swap. The deal was financed by a $1 billion loan from JP Morgan with $1 billion political risk insurance cover from DFC, the United States\u2019 development finance institution, and a $200 million standby letter of credit from CAF, the Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean, likely lowering the cost of the lending. The Galapagos Islands, one of the world\u2019s most precious ecosystems, was the conservation focus of Ecuador\u2019s debt-for-nature swap. The $1.6 billion buy-back helped cut Ecuador\u2019s debt by over $1 billion once the $450 million of total conservation spending is taken into account. The deal has since faced criticism from local groups raising concerns about their lack of involvement in the deal. Gabon landed continental Africa\u2019s first debt-for-nature swap in 2023. Issuing a new lower-cost $500 million \u201cblue bond\u201d to buy back at a discount $436 million of its international bonds, the central African country freed up around $163 million for conservation projects over a 15-year period. Gabon, whose beaches and coastal waters are home to the world\u2019s largest population of endangered leatherback turtles, said it planned to use the money saved to tackle illegal fishing and fulfill a pledge to protect 30% of its coastal waters. Barbados completed a $150 million debt conversion in September 2022, freeing up $50 million of long-term financing for marine conservation with the government promising to protect up to 30% of seas covered by its territorial and sovereign rights. The deal was funded by a 15-year dual currency blue loan arranged by Credit Suisse and CIBC First Caribbean. Belize in 2021 committed to spend $4 million a year and fund a $23 million marine conservation trust to protect the world\u2019s second-largest coral reef by buying back and retiring a $533 million bond. Backed by nonprofit The Nature Conservancy, the US International Development Finance Corporation and Credit Suisse, the deal provided about $200 million in debt relief to the Central American country. The Seychelles\u2019 debt-for-nature swap took dealmakers almost six years from design to disbursement. First mooted in 2012 the deal saw the Seychelles government buy back $21.6 million of debt from the Paris Club group of wealthy nations in 2016, financed by a loan from NGO The Nature Conservancy as well as philanthropic grants. In 2018, Seychelles raised additional funding for conservation by issuing a $15 million blue bond, backed by a partial credit guarantee from the World Bank. \u2013 Rappler.com \nError.\n\n \n\t\t\tPlease abide by Rappler's commenting guidelines.\n\t\t \n\t\tThere are no comments yet.

Paul Halfacre, St. Louis Post-Dispatch Edwardsville senior Iose Epenesa smiles after signing his letter of intent during signing day on December 4, 2024 at Edwardsville High School in Edwardsville, Ill. Paul Halfacre, St. Louis Post-Dispatch EDWARDSVILLE \u2014 There was an assumption with many that Clayton Lakatos would follow the path blazed by his father. Chad Lakatos, a highly decorated track coach at Edwardsville High School, knew better. \"As a little kid, he's always wanted to play football,\" Chad Lakatos said. \"I'm just so happy for him and being able to continue to play the sport that he loves.\" The smile on Clayton Lakatos' face told the tale when he sat in front of a packed auditorium at Edwardsville High School on Wednesday night as he and fellow senior Iose Epenesa signed their national letters of intent to play college football. \"It's one of my favorite parts, where you get to see the payoffs,\" Edwardsville coach Kelsey Pickering said. \"When you have young people signing letters and going on to continue their education and football career, it's an exciting moment, there's no doubt about it.\" Lakatos signed his letter of intent to play at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, while Epenesa \u2014 the No. 1 recruit on the Post-Dispatch Super 30 countdown \u2014\u00a0signed his letter to follow in his family's footsteps and play at the University of Iowa. Wednesday was the first day high school senior football players could sign binding national letters of intent in the early period for NCAA Division I programs. The early period concludes Friday, and the regular signing period, including NCAA Division II programs, begins Feb. 5, 2025, and continues through April 1 for Division I players and Aug. 1 for Division II players. Edwardsville's season ended this year with a 37-7 loss to eventual runner-up Elmhurst York in the first round of the Class 8A playoffs. Lakatos, a bolt of lightning on the track, joined forces with the raw throwing power of Epenesa to form the core of the 2024 Class 3A state championship track and field team as well as leaders of an imposing defense in the Southwestern Conference for the past four seasons.\u00a0 Training on the track certainly helped Lakatos' performance on the gridiron. \"I think that's why most schools recruit me was my speed, and I think that's my strongest attribute on the field,\" Lakatos said. \"Track just helps me be faster on the field in every way.\" Lakatos had 1,019 total yards and nine touchdowns on offense during his career and brought the hammer on defense with 120 tackles in four years. He also had 424 return yards and two TDs on returns as a senior. \"I like to lift all the track season,\" Lakatos said. \"I'm always lifting, so I think I have some pretty decent strength in the weight room, which definitely helps.\" Though he flirted with the idea of track in college, when the offers started flowing in from his exploits on the football field, that's when Lakatos knew where his future would be. And joining with former Edwardsville teammate Jake Curry in Carbondale was too good to pass up. Epenesa is the third successive Edwardsville defensive standout signing at Iowa, joining brothers Eric and AJ, who have suited up for the Hawkeyes. AJ Epenesa is in his fifth season with the Buffalo Bills in the National Football League.\u00a0 \"It was just a big relief for me to be able to call Iowa my home finally,\" Iose Epenesa said. In four years, Epenesa totaled 173 tackles and a program-record 23 sacks. Pickering, who has seen all three brothers on the gridiron, wasn't ready to crown any of them as the best. He quickly pointed out that all three of them were chasing the eldest Epenesa, Sam Epenesa, who played volleyball at Purdue University. \"The best athlete in the family is Sam, the oldest sister,\" Pickering said. \"I've never seen anybody play volleyball the way she played volleyball. And so these all these three boys are all chasing her.\" Iose Epenesa agreed wholeheartedly that Sam has them all beat in the athletic category. \"Everyone always says Sam is the best athlete and I believe it,\" Iose Epenesa said.\u00a0 Sharing the stage once more with Lakatos meant the world to Epenesa. \"We grew up like playing against each other, doing all these things, and to be able to share the spot with him, it's pretty awesome to see,\" Epenesa said. The pair will look to repeat as track champions this year, as Lakatos wasn't ready to see his high school career end early. \"We're going try to go back to back in state championships,\" Lakatos said. \"I don't want to waste away high school. I love my friends, family, house and everybody here. So I don't want to waste it away. I want to enjoy it for as long as I can.\" Area college signings for NCAA Division I and II schools, as submitted by athletics directors and coaches.

Along with this, the chances of Fed going for another rate cut has dimmed, which has given further support to the US Dollar Index, thereby negatively affecting gold prices. Domestically, the correction is here for the better as India enters the wedding season, one of the two biggest gold-buying seasons in the country. Given the sentimental value attached to the yellow metal, price factor plays a minimal role in influencing the buyer\u2019s decision, keeping the overall demand robust. Going ahead, gold prices are likely to stay volatile for the short term and will be majorly guided by the movement in USD and Fed\u2019s take on further rate cuts in the upcoming meetings.\u201d The rupee depreciated 13 paise to close at an all-time low of 84.73 (provisional) against the US dollar on Monday, on disappointing macroeconomic data and broad strength of the American currency in the overseas markets.

GVA grew modestly at 5.6%, with manufacturing dipping to 2.2% and inflation eroding urban demand. However, agriculture provided some relief, rising 3.5%, aided by favorable monsoons. After the announcement, G-sec yields fell across maturities, with the 1-year OIS dropping from 6.5075% to 6.3625%, and the 2-year OIS dropping from 6.2350% to 6.0375% signaling an increased likelihood of rate cuts. Bond yields also declined, with the old and new 10Y yields, for instance, dropping by 6 bps.\u00a0 The contraction in manufacturing growth and weaker consumption data likely contributed to expectations of RBI intervention. The decline in OIS rates further suggests the market\u2019s anticipation of easier monetary policy. The slowdown has intensified pressure on the RBI to consider interest rate cuts to support growth. Policymakers are optimistic about rural demand stabilizing the economy, but a sharp rebound is necessary to meet annual growth projections. The weekend brought bad macro news for the market \u2013 a weak GDP print, uninspiring fiscal data, and a Trump tariff threat to BRICS. This should trigger some near-term weakness in the markets, but some of this was already known and partially priced in. We do not see the case for a major market sell-off but reiterate that near-term upside is also limited due to earnings weakness and valuations. We keep our Dec-25E Nifty target unchanged at 25,000. An incremental correction over 5% in the Nifty is an entry opportunity, in our view. GDP miss known and partially priced in The weak earnings season, with the BSE-500 delivering zero YoY earnings growth, already told us that the economy faced a growth challenge in 2QFY25. The market absorbed that information with an 8% fall in the BSE-500 since 28-Sep and a 2.5% cut in Nifty earnings forecasts for FY25. Beyond the sticker-shock impact, we do not see this as incrementally game-changing news. Penciling-in a capex recovery We have penciled-in a 2HFY25 recovery, but it is likely to be led by central government capex. Spending is behind the curve and the mathematical 61% YoY asking rate for Nov-24 to Mar-25 puts the annual target at risk. However, we expect a sharp sequential pick-up in sectors like defense and railways. The sharp decline in government balances is an indicator of this. Channel checks also indicate that the government has started to disburse pending balances, which is trickling into incremental demand. Consumption demand \u2013 sluggish for 2H Consumption demand has been disappointing for 1HFY25 and we think the recovery will be pushed into FY26. There have been multiple macro challenges \u2013 high base, weak jobs market, and credit tightening by the RBI. Our expectations of a mass category consumption revival also appears to have been belied with FMCG companies reporting weak numbers. We believe these are temporary factors but a turnaround will take at least 2-3 quarters and a revival seen only in FY26. Ball in RBI\u2019s court A silver lining is that the weak growth opens the door for an RBI rate cut in Dec-24. There are challenges, however: inflation is still running hot at over 6% and the DXY strength puts the RBI in a tricky spot for the next 1-2 quarters. Trump\u2019s threats to retaliate with sanctions on BRICS countries attempting de-dollarization add to the uncertainty. We believe that rate cuts will anyway have a limited impact as leverage levels are low. An RBI rethink of lending curbs on banks and NBFCs, however, would have a more meaningful impact. Sectoral preferences We would stay away from consumer-led sectors due to our expectations of a delayed revival in consumption vs capex. Our key OW remain IT\/Energy\/Materials\/Utilities whereas we remain UW on Staples. We see a tactical opportunity in Financials but would use the rally to sell, as we remain structurally UW on the sector In the last week, emotions ran high as the market moved sharply up on Monday and the gains were negated by a sharp fall on Thursday. The underlying news events were just as conflicting - optimism prevailed after the Maharashtra election results but the allegations about the Adani group raised concerns among investors. On Friday, the excitement in the Pharma and Auto stocks helped the Nifty close up 0.91% at 24,131.10 while the S&P BSE Sensex settled 0.96% higher at 759.05 points. The market\u2019s apparent discounting of the anticipated slowdown in India\u2019s Q2 GDP to 6.5% suggests that traders are looking beyond short-term economic data and focusing on the longer-term growth prospects of the Indian economy. We are starting the forthcoming week with conflicting events. The Maharashtra election results gave a clear mandate to the Mahayuti alliance, but it has shown uncertainty regarding the leadership pick of the Chief Minister. Adani stocks have mostly recovered from the rout in earlier week but a new concern emerged about the GDP slump. The GDP growth number has come down to 5.4%, compared to 8.1% in the corresponding quarter a year back. The candlestick pattern suggests the nearest resistance level at 24,350-24,360 for the index. Many traders will likely be hesitant to buy above this level, remembering past failures to break through this resistance. A breakout above this level could trigger a wave of buying, fueled by the fear of missing out (FOMO). As long as the index remains below 24,360, short-term traders may book profits on any bounce and wait for a fresh breakout. Holding on to positions for too long, hoping for further gains, can be detrimental if the market reverses its course. Global markets are grappling with anxieties stemming from geopolitical tensions and uncertainties surrounding the U.S. Fed\u2019s interest rate decisions. The possibility of changing global trade dynamics under President-elect Donald Trump, particularly due to the threat of U.S. tariffs, is further adding to the global market unease. The Indian rupee, while ending Friday relatively flat at 84.4825, remains precariously close to its all-time low of 84.5075, reached just last week. In contrast to the anxieties impacting Asian markets and currencies, the U.S. dollar has experienced a surge, mirroring a similar upward trend in U.S. yields, ever since Donald Trump\u2019s election victory in early November. Though Nifty has shown strength in the last week, the medium-term trend remains weak. From its September high of around 26,277, the Nifty is still down almost 12%. Novice traders often confuse short-term and long-term trends, potentially leading them to make impulsive decisions during these consolidations. It is crucial to remember that the market is designed to exploit such mistakes. Traders should focus on managing positions with a pre-determined strategy, rather than trying to predict every short-term fluctuation.

However, concerns arise regarding potential conflicts of interest with other LG entities and the lack of exclusivity agreements.","url":"https:\/\/www.digitimes.com\/news\/a20241209VL201\/lg-electronics-india-ipo-electronics-market.html","published_at":"2024-12-09T02:53:39Z","content":"Credit: AFP LG Electronics India filed an IPO in India, aiming to capitalize on the country's growing appliances and electronics market. However, concerns arise regarding potential conflicts of interest with other LG entities and the lack of exclusivity agreements. LG Electronics India, the Indian arm of South Korea's LG Electronics, submitted draft documents to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for an IPO. This move marks a significant step as the offering is structured as an offer for sale (OFS), whereby the parent company plans to divest 101.8 billion equity shares. The transaction will see LG Electronics' stake in its Indian subsidiary reduced by 15%, holding onto 576.9 billion shares post-IPO. Notably, this offering will not generate new capital for LG Electronics India as it involves no fresh issuance of shares. The process of bringing LG Electronics India to the stock market will be shepherded by prominent merchant banks, including Morgan Stanley India, JP Morgan India, Axis Capital, BofA Securities India, and Citigroup Global Markets India, according to reports from The Times of India. This strategy positions LG Electronics India to become only the second South Korean conglomerate, or chaebol, to enter Indian stock exchanges, following in the footsteps of Hyundai Motors India. In the draft documents, LG Electronics India has claimed its market leadership in major home appliances and consumer electronics in India, with exclusions for the mobile phone segment through June 30, 2024. The company has proudly maintained this position for 13 consecutive years from 2011 through 2023 regarding volume and value market share within the offline channel. India's burgeoning appliances and electronics sector has reportedly grown at an average rate of 7% over the past five years. Expecting a boost, LG Electronics India forecasts this growth to accelerate to approximately 12% over the next half-decade. This optimistic projection is underpinned by increased disposable incomes, accelerated urbanization, and deeper market penetration in urban and rural landscapes. Despite the promising outlook, concerns loom, as reported by the Economic Times, citing anonymous sources within the company. LG Electronics India has flagged potential competitive risks if its parent company decides to establish independent ventures in the region, as no binding exclusivity agreement governs their mutual operations. Such developments could trigger conflicts of interest, significantly affecting LG Electronics India's business and financial status. Further complicating the landscape is LG's fully-owned Indian subsidiary, Hi-M Solutek India, dedicated to maintaining LG's commercial air conditioning systems. While focused solely on LG products, Hi-M Solutek's mandate includes system construction, service and maintenance, and specialized engineering services. The lack of exclusivity raises the possibility that Hi-M Solutek might broaden its service offerings, compete directly with LG Electronics India, or cater to other brands, adding another layer of complexity to the already competitive business environment."},{"source":"Texasobserver.org","author":"dgfitch","title":"Revealed: the Operators Behind Four Major Neo-Nazi X Accounts","description":"Anonymity has long been a tactic used by extremists to spread their ideology while avoiding social consequences, from Klansmen hoods to online pseudonyms.","url":"https:\/\/www.texasobserver.org\/revealed-operators-neo-nazi-x-accounts\/","published_at":"2024-12-07T05:47:01Z","content":"Under owner Elon Musk, the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter, has become a hotbed of white supremacist and neo-Nazi content.

On Sunday, as rebels entered the capital, a Syrian war monitor said he had left the country, in what could spell the end not just of his 24-year rule but the downfall of his clan's five-decade reign. After facing down nationwide protests demanding his ouster and an armed rebellion that he all but crushed, Assad had -- until a lightning rebel offensive -- taken back control of much of Syria in the civil war that began in 2011. Quiet in demeanour, Assad had for years relied on his alliances with Russia, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah in order to maintain power.  While leading a merciless war of survival for his rule, he presented himself to his people and the outside world as Syria's only viable leader in the face of the Islamist threat. But an Islamist-led rebel offensive that began on November 27 wrested city after city from Assad's control. On Sunday the rebels announced they had entered Damascus. Shortly afterwards, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said he had left the country, while the rebels themselves said the \"tyrant\" had \"fled\". For years, Assad had cast himself as the protector of Syria's minorities, a bulwark against extremism and the sole possible purveyor of stability for a country ravaged by war. In multiple votes held over the years, conducted solely on government-held territory, he took the vast majority of the ballots, amid accusations from Western countries and rights groups that the elections were neither free nor fair. In official meetings, during interviews and even on the front lines, the 59-year-old ophthalmologist by training conducted himself calmly. Behind the facade, however, was an astonishing ability to hold onto power amid multiple waves of violence and transformative change in Syria and the wider region. One journalist, who met with Assad on several occasions before and after war broke out in 2011, told AFP Assad is a \"unique and complex figure\". Assad has \"the same qualities\" as his father, Hafez al-Assad, who ruled Syria for nearly three decades until his death in 2000, said the journalist, who declined to be named. Hafez al-Assad, head of the Syrian Baath Party, imposed in the country a secretive, paranoid regime where even the slightest suspicion of dissent could land one in jail or worse. Bashar al-Assad was never meant to become president, but his life changed radically when his older brother Bassel, who was being groomed to inherit power, died in a road accident in 1994. Bashar quit his studies in ophthalmology and left London, where he had met his wife Asma, a British-Syrian and Sunni Muslim who worked for financial services firm JP Morgan. Back home, he took a course in military studies and was tutored in politics by his father. When the latter died, Bashar became president by referendum, running unopposed, then winning a second term in 2007. Sworn in at the age of 34, Assad was initially seen by Syrians pining for freedoms as a reformer who could do away with years of repression and introduce economic liberalisation. In the early days, Assad would be seen driving his own car or having dinner at restaurants with his wife. He relaxed some of the heavy restrictions that existed under his father. But his initial image as a reformer quickly evaporated as authorities arrested and jailed academics, intellectuals and other members of what was then known as the Damascus Spring movement. When the Arab Spring reached Syria in March 2011, peaceful demonstrations broke out calling for change. Assad, who was also commander-in-chief of the armed forces, responded by ordering a brutal crackdown on the protesters and civil war swiftly ensued. Throughout the war, which killed more than 500,000 people and displaced half the population, Assad's position on the demonstrators and the opposition did not change. To Syria and to the world, he justified the bombings and military campaigns as a war on \"terrorists\". Meanwhile, his security apparatus enforced a brutal system of imprisoning dissidents in a network of detention centres and jails dotted around the country that have become notorious for abuses. He was the subject of countless cartoons by dissident artists depicting him as a killer, not least in the aftermath of the 2013 chemical attacks on rebel bastions around Damascus. Since the start of the Islamist-led rebel offensive, Assad has echoed his long-held stance that the conflict in Syria is machinated from abroad. \"The terrorist escalation reflects the far-reaching goals of dividing the region and fragmenting the countries in it and (to) redraw the map in line with the objectives of the United States and the West,\" Assad said on Monday. He is the father of three children. His wife, Asma, was dubbed a \"rose in the desert\" by Vogue magazine before the revolt.

But will he get in the way?","description":"S&P 500 is tipped to gain 7% next year, but will it?","url":"https:\/\/www.irishtimes.com\/business\/2024\/12\/07\/trumps-favourite-index-is-tipped-to-rally-further-in-2025-but-will-he-get-in-the-way\/","published_at":"2024-12-07T06:00:00Z","content":"Donald Trump\u2019s vetting of cabinet picks second time round may have thrown up some blunders, with his nominee to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) this week following the fate of Matt Gaetz\u2019s short-lived candidacy for attorney general. Chad Chronister, currently a Florida sheriff, withdrew his name to run the DEA from consideration \u2013 though Trump says he pulled the plug \u2013 on Wednesday as a result of uproar among Republicans over his arrest of a pastor in 2020 for holding large services during a Covid lockdown. It follows Gaetz withdrawing his name for lawyer-in-chief last month amid allegations of sexual misconduct. However, the band Trump is putting together elsewhere \u2013 including hedge fund billionaire Scott Bessent being picked as treasury secretary, oil industry veteran Chris Wright as energy secretary, stockbroking firm Cantor Fitzgerald chief executive Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary, and Paul Atkins, a free marketeer and crypto-friendly lawyer, as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2013 has been warmly received at a constituency close to his heart: Wall Street. The stock market, as we learned during Trump\u2019s first term in office, is Trump\u2019s favoured barometer of success \u2013 having regularly peppered speeches back then with the question, \u201cHow\u2019s your 401(K) doing?\u201d That referred to the stock-laden retirement savings vehicles used by more than 100 million Americans. New York\u2019s S&P 500 index of blue-chip US companies, the world\u2019s most widely followed equities index, has advanced almost 5.5 per cent since Trump outflanked Kamala Harris just over a month ago \u2013 bringing its advance so far this year to 28 per cent, and to an all-time high. Investors have committed almost $140 billion (\u20ac132.3 billion) of fresh money to US equity funds since the election, with November being the busiest month for inflows on records stretching back to 2000, on hopes the incoming administration will unleash sweeping tax cuts and reforms to help corporate America, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing figures from market data provider EPFR. The S&P 500, which has a major influence on stock markets globally, is on track to reach 6,500 points by the end of next year, according to median forecast of 48 equity strategists recently polled by Reuters. That points to about a 7 per cent advance from current levels. Former Iseq heavyweights CRH and Flutter Entertainment have quit the Irish market in the past 15 months and moved their main listings to the US with an aim of ultimately joining the S&P 500. Smurfit Kappa secured direct entry to the index in July when it merged with a US cardboard box-making rival to form Smurfit Westrock. But never has the US market been dominated by so few. The so-called magnificent seven group of high-performing stocks \u2013 including Nvidia, the maker of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) computer chips, Microsoft, Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Apple and Amazon \u2013 have driven the broader market higher in 2024. Nvidia\u2019s 200 per cent surge alone has fuelled a fifth of the S&P 500\u2019s gain this year. And the seven are seen leading the way again in 2025, according to strategists. There\u2019s a lot of hope priced into equities right now. But investors don\u2019t have to look too far to see red flags. Following this year\u2019s rally, companies on the S&P 500 are trading at an average of 23 times expected earnings, according to stock market research firm Birinyi Associates. That\u2019s well over the 10-year average of about 18. Tech valuations are even more stretched. Joe Davis, chief economist of Vanguard, the world\u2019s second-largest manager, warned this week that the market had overestimated the short-term potential of AI technology, increasing the risk of a price \u201ccorrection\u201d. He said some tech valuations were approaching those of 1997 \u2013 referring to the tech bubble era. While JP Morgan strategists were upbeat on equities in their 2025 market outlook, published this week, as central banks continue to ease interest rates and the new US administration embarks on a programme of deregulation, they warned of a risk of \u201cdisruptive Trump policies triggering a crash landing\u201d. Historically high prices for US housing, crypto currencies (Bitcoin breached $100,000 for the first time on Thursday) and gold, as well as low corporate bond market interest rates, relative to risk, broaden the potential fallout. The Central Bank of Ireland highlighted in a report this week that there is a \u201cwidening disconnect\u201d between economic uncertainty \u2013 also stemming from the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East, and fears about a possible US-China clash over Taiwan \u2013 and current low volatility in global equity and debt markets. This increases the chances of a \u201csharp repricing of assets\u201d, it warned. Trump 2.0, with a return of \u201cAmerica first\u201d, has already seen the president-elect suggest universal tariffs on all goods imported to the US and sharply higher levies on Chinese goods. He has also threatened neighbouring Mexico and Canada with 25 per cent taxes on goods from both unless they stem immigration to the US and flows of drugs. Economists have said tariffs will be inflationary and force the US Federal Reserve to reverse course on its current cycle of easing interest rates. \u201cThe effects would be inflationary in the short term \u2013 with companies facing higher input costs and consumers paying more for finished goods; [and be] a drag on US GDP in the medium term, while underpinning still-high benchmark interest rates,\u201d said S&P Global Ratings. GDP stands for gross domestic product. Inflation could also be stoked if mass deportations of illegal immigrants kick in \u2013 or people start self-deporting in droves \u2013 under Trump. Fewer workers in some industries could put upward pressure on wages. Stock market bulls argue Trump will be quick to change course on any economically disruptive policies if they lead to a stock market sell-off. But that won\u2019t prevent volatility in the meantime. And incoming cabinet members should know from the experience of the walking wounded from Trump\u2019s first administration, he\u2019ll always find someone else to blame.

But the very fact the question arose is a reminder of the pressing need for political funding reform on this side of the Atlantic.   Musk is the living embodiment of economic power in the modern US: a multibillionaire, with spicy political views, who has bought his way into a role as Donald Trump\u2019s costcutter-in-chief.   Part of his motivation seems to be not just slashing spending for the sake of it but the dismantling of regulators that his companies have found irksome.   Related:  Money, lawyers or boosting Farage on X: how Elon Musk could affect UK politics   He had previously joined legal action, alongside Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, aimed at having the National Labor Relations Board declared unconstitutional, for example.   This is the body, created in 1935, that enforces workers\u2019 rights. It ensured staff at Amazon\u2019s Staten Island warehouse had the opportunity to ballot \u2013 successfully \u2013  for union recognition  (an outcome the giant retailer has continued to challenge).   Musk has also said he wants  to \u201cdelete\u201d the Consumer Financial Protection Agency  , suggesting it is \u201cduplicative\u201d.   Musk et al\u2019s affront at the very idea that federal agencies have oversight of business is reminiscent of the fury faced by President Theodore Roosevelt and his allies during the so-called Progressive Era, at the turn of the 20th century, when they fought to bust vast monopolies and tame the worst excesses of capitalism.   The mega-rich capitalists back then were the likes of JD Rockefeller and JP Morgan but then, as now, there was a clash of principles about the government\u2019s right to oversee corporations. And then, as now, money was used to buy influence over the debate.   If Musk and his co-director, Vivek Ramaswamy, succeed in scrapping a whole suite of regulators, it could fundamentally shift the relationship between capital and the individual (which, of course, is exactly his hope).   Related:  Musk and Ramaswamy tout \u2018Doge\u2019 plan on Capitol Hill \u2013 how will it work?   Musk\u2019s deregulatory zeal may yet run into trouble in Congress, and Trump may tire of his fellow egotist and end up wheeling out his catchphrase from the Apprentice to tell the Tesla boss \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d.   But the immense influence Musk has bought, by spending  an extraordinary $243m  (\u00a3190m) on getting Trump re-elected, and using X to pump out pro-Trump propaganda, should sound alarm bells in the UK.   We may lack the equivalent of Silicon Valley\u2019s galactically rich donor class, with their screwball libertarianism. But we still have a system where wealthy individuals can effectively give unlimited sums to their favourite political parties.   There are spending limits during campaigns, but these are very high: for a party standing candidates in every seat in the UK, it topped \u00a334m at this year\u2019s general election.   Party funding rules state that you have to be a UK citizen to give more than \u00a3500 \u2013 or a UK-registered company, which \u201ccarries out business in the UK\u201d.   So even if Musk felt so minded, he could not donate as an individual, but would have to channel any donation to Farage\u2019s crew via the UK outpost of Twitter, now known as X.   But the very fact he could do so in theory highlights the gaping holes in our funding rules.   Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour seems at ease with big money. Labour declared three times as much in donations as all other parties combined during this year\u2019s election campaign \u2013  more than \u00a39.5m  \u2013 with big donors including the trade unions, of course, but also  wealthy individuals  , such as Lord Sainsbury, the former chair of the supermarket chain, as well as the Autoglass founder, Gary Lubner, and the hedge fund manager Martin Taylor.   Yet the row over freebies \u2013 which led to Starmer being castigated over donations of glasses and gig tickets \u2013 revealed a deep public scepticism over the role of private money in politics.   Just as with the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal, a practice that Westminster considered perfectly normal was shown to be deeply unpalatable to voters.   Labour\u2019s manifesto included a promise to \u201cprotect democracy by strengthening the rules around donations to political parties\u201d. It is unclear what that meant, and it didn\u2019t feature in Labour\u2019s first king\u2019s speech, but my colleague Eleni Courea has reported that Labour  will look closely at a forthcoming report  from the IPPR thinktank, which is expected to recommend a \u00a3100,000 annual cap on individual donations.   Cross-party talks on political funding have often foundered on Labour\u2019s reluctance to accept any cap on trade union donations. This is a difficult circle to square \u2013 Labour is, after all, the party of labour. At the very least, union donations should be democratically endorsed, so that they function as much as possible like a collection of individual members\u2019 subs.   On this basis, plans in the employment bill to move to an \u201copt out\u201d approach for union political funds seem like a backwards step (though the unions would point out that they do hold regular votes on how their political funds are used).   Transparency International, which campaigns to drive big money out of politics, recommends a much lower \u00a310,000 cap on donations, and has  a slate of other suggestions  \u2013 including reducing campaign spending limits, which were raised dramatically by the Tories. Labour would be wise to look closely at these, too.   Political funding reform should be a worthy aim in itself, without the looming threat of the populist right. But If Elon Musk\u2019s enthusiasm for Nigel Farage helps motivate the UK\u2019s mainstream parties to crack on with cleaning up politics, both men will have made an unexpectedly positive contribution to public life.
